    <h2>
      FIRST CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SUICIDE&rsquo;S CHAIR
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! I&rsquo;m not mistaken at all! <i>It&rsquo;s the same woman!</i>&rdquo; whispered the
      tall, good-looking young Englishman in a well-cut navy suit as he stood
      with his friend, a man some ten years older than himself, at one of the
      roulette tables at Monte Carlo, the first on the right on entering the
      room&mdash;that one known to habitual gamblers as &ldquo;The Suicide&rsquo;s Table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite certain?&rdquo; asked his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positive. I should know her again anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very handsome. And look, too, by Jove!&mdash;how she is winning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But let&rsquo;s get away. She might recognize me,&rdquo; exclaimed the younger
      man anxiously. &ldquo;Ah! If I could only induce her to disclose what she knows
      about my poor father&rsquo;s mysterious end then we might clear up the mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, if all we hear is true about her, Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo
      will never do that,&rdquo; was the other&rsquo;s reply as they moved away together
      down the long saloon towards the trente-et-quarante room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Messieurs! Faites vos jeux</i>,&rdquo; the croupiers were crying in their
      strident, monotonous voices, inviting players to stake their counters of
      cent-sous, their louis, or their hundred or five hundred franc notes upon
      the spin of the red and black wheel. It was the month of March, the height
      of the Riviera season, the fetes of Mi-Careme were in full swing. That
      afternoon the rooms were overcrowded, and the tense atmosphere of gambling
      was laden with the combined odours of perspiration and perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around each table were crowds four or five deep behind those fortunate
      enough to obtain seats, all eager and anxious to try their fortune upon
      the rouge or noir, or upon one of the thirty-six numbers, the columns, or
      the transversales. There was but little chatter. The hundreds of
      well-dressed idlers escaping the winter were too intent upon the game. But
      above the click of the plaques, blue and red of different sizes, as they
      were raked into the bank by the croupiers, and the clatter of counters as
      the lucky players were paid with deft hands, there rose ever and anon:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Messieurs! Faites vos jeux!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here English duchesses rubbed shoulders with the most notorious women in
      Europe, and men who at home in England were good churchmen and exemplary
      fathers of families, laughed merrily with the most gorgeously attired
      cocottes from Paris, or the stars of the film world or the variety stage.
      Upon that wide polished floor of the splendidly decorated Rooms, with
      their beautiful mural paintings and heavy gilt ornamentation, the world
      and the half-world were upon equal footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into that stifling atmosphere&mdash;for the Administration of the Bains de
      Mer of Monaco seem as afraid of fresh air as of purity propaganda&mdash;the
      glorious afternoon sunlight struggled through the curtained windows, while
      over each table, in addition to the electric light, oil-lamps shaded green
      with a billiard-table effect cast a dull, ghastly illumination upon the
      eager countenances of the players. Most of those who go to Monte Carlo
      wonder at the antiquated mode of illumination. It is, however, in
      consequence of an attempted raid upon the tables one night, when some
      adventurers cut the electric-light main, and in the darkness grabbed all
      they could get from the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two English visitors, both men of refinement and culture, who had
      watched the tall, very handsome woman in black, to whom the older man had
      referred as Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo, wandered through the
      trente-et-quarante rooms where all was silence, and counters, representing
      gold, were being staked with a twelve-thousand franc maximum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those rooms beyond are the haunt of the professional gambler, the man or
      woman who has been seized by the demon of speculation, just as others have
      been seized by that of drugs or drink. Curiously enough women are more
      prone to gamble than men, and the Administration of the Etablissement will
      tell you that when a woman of any nationality starts to gamble she will
      become reckless until her last throw with the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who know Monte Carlo, those who have been habitues for twenty years&mdash;as
      the present writer has been&mdash;know too well, and have seen too often,
      the deadly influence of the tables upon the lighter side of woman&rsquo;s
      nature. The smart woman from Paris, Vienna, or Rome never loses her head.
      She gambles always discreetly. The fashionable cocottes seldom lose much.
      They gamble at the tables discreetly and make eyes at men if they win, or
      if they lose. If the latter they generally obtain a &ldquo;loan&rdquo; from somebody.
      What matter? When one is at &ldquo;Monty&rdquo; one is not in a Wesleyan chapel.
      English men and women when they go to the Riviera leave their morals at
      home with their silk hats and Sunday gowns. And it is strange to see the
      perfectly respectable Englishwoman admiring the same daring costumes of
      the French pseudo-&ldquo;countesses&rdquo; at which they have held up their hands in
      horror when they have seen them pictured in the papers wearing those
      latest &ldquo;creations&rdquo; of the Place Vendome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. It is a hypocritical world, and nowhere is canting hypocrisy more
      apparent than inside the Casino at Monte Carlo.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the two Englishmen were strolling over the polished parquet of the
      elegant world-famous <i>salles-de-jeu</i> &ldquo;Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo&rdquo;
       was experiencing quite an extraordinary run of luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      But &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; as the croupiers always called her, was usually lucky.
      She was an experienced, and therefore a careful player. When she staked a
      maximum it was not without very careful calculation upon the chances.
      Mademoiselle was well known to the Administration. Often her winnings were
      sensational, hence she served as an advertisement to the Casino, for her
      success always induced the uninitiated and unwary to stake heavily, and
      usually with disastrous results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green-covered gaming table, at which she was sitting next to the end
      croupier on the left-hand side, was crowded. She sat in what is known at
      Monte as &ldquo;the Suicide&rsquo;s Chair,&rdquo; for during the past eight years ten men
      and women had sat in that fatal chair and had afterwards ended their lives
      abruptly, and been buried in secret in the Suicide&rsquo;s Cemetery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The croupiers at that table are ever watchful of the visitor who, all
      unawares, occupies that fatal chair. But Mademoiselle, who knew of it,
      always laughed the superstition to scorn. She habitually sat in that chair&mdash;and
      won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, that afternoon she was winning&mdash;and very considerably too.
      She had won four maximums <i>en plein</i> within the last half-hour, and
      the crowd around the table noting her good fortune were now following her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy for any novice in the Rooms to see that the handsome,
      dark-eyed woman was a practised player. Time after time she let the coups
      pass. The croupiers&rsquo; invitation to play did not interest her. She simply
      toyed with her big gold-chain purse, or fingered her dozen piles or so of
      plaques in a manner quite disinterested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the croupier announce the winning number and saw the rakes at
      work dragging in the stakes to swell the bank. But she only smiled, and
      now and then shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether she won or lost, or whether she did not risk a stake, she simply
      smiled and elevated her shoulders, muttering something to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo was, truth to tell, a sphinx to the staff of
      the Casino. She looked about thirty, but probably she was older. For five
      years she had been there each season and gambled heavily with unvarying
      success. Always well but quietly dressed, her nationality was as obscure
      as her past. To the staff she was always polite, and she pressed
      hundred-franc notes into many a palm in the Rooms. But who she was or what
      were her antecedents nobody in the Principality of Monaco could ever tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole Cote d&rsquo;Azur from Hyeres to Ventimiglia knew of her. She was one
      of the famous characters of Monte Carlo, just as famous, indeed, as old
      Mr. Drewett, the Englishman who lost his big fortune at the tables, and
      who was pensioned off by the Administration on condition that he never
      gamble at the Casino again. For fifteen years he lived in Nice upon the
      meagre pittance until suddenly another fortune was left him, whereupon he
      promptly paid up the whole of his pension and started at the tables again.
      In a month, however, he had lost his second fortune. Such is gambling in
      the little country ruled over by Prince Rouge-et-Noir.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two Englishmen slipped past the end table unseen on their way out
      into the big atrium with its many columns&mdash;the hall in which players
      go out to cool themselves, or collect their determination for a final
      flutter&mdash;Mademoiselle had just won the maximum upon the number four,
      as well as the column, and the croupier was in the act of pushing towards
      her a big pile of counters each representing a thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eager excited throng around the table looked across at her with envy.
      But her handsome countenance was quite expressionless. She simply thrust
      the counters into the big gold-chain purse at her side, glanced at the
      white-gloved fingers which were soiled by handling the counters, and then
      counting out twenty-five, each representing a louis, gave them to the
      croupier, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Zero-trois!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next moment a dozen persons followed her play, staking their cent-sous and
      louis upon the spot where she had asked the croupier at the end of the
      table to place her stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Messieurs! Faites vos jeux!</i>&rdquo; came the strident cry again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a few seconds later the croupier cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Rien ne vas plus!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The red and black wheel was already spinning, and the little ivory ball
      sent by the croupier&rsquo;s hand in the opposite direction was clicking quickly
      over the numbered spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six hundred or more eyes of men and women, fevered by the gambling mania,
      watched the result. Slowly it lost its impetus, and after spinning about
      unevenly it made a final jump and fell with a loud click.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Zer-r-o!</i>&rdquo; cried the croupier.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a moment later Mademoiselle had pushed before her at the end of the
      croupier&rsquo;s rake another pile of counters, while all those who had followed
      the remarkable woman&rsquo;s play were also paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle is in good form to-day,&rdquo; remarked one ugly old Frenchwoman
      who had been a well-known figure at the tables for the past ten years, and
      who played carefully and lived by gambling. She was one of those queer,
      mysterious old creatures who enter the Rooms each morning as soon as they
      are open, secure the best seats, occupy them all the luncheon hour
      pretending to play, and then sell them to wealthy gamblers for a
      consideration&mdash;two or three louis&mdash;perhaps&mdash;and then at
      once go to their ease in their own obscure abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public who go to Monte know little of its strange mysteries, or of the
      odd people who pick up livings there in all sorts of queer ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed a man who overheard her. &ldquo;Mademoiselle has wonderful luck!
      She won seventy-five thousand francs at the <i>Cercle Prive</i> last
      night. She won <i>en plein</i> five times running. <i>Dieu!</i> Such luck!
      And it never causes her the slightest excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady must be very rich!&rdquo; remarked an American woman sitting next to
      the old Frenchwoman, and who knew French well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich! Of course! She must have won several million francs from the
      Administration. They don&rsquo;t like to see her here. But I suppose her success
      attracts others to play. The gambling fever is as infectious as the
      influenza,&rdquo; declared the old Frenchwoman. &ldquo;Everyone tries to discover who
      she is, and where she came from five years ago. But nobody has yet found
      out. Even Monsieur Bernard, the chief of the Surveillance, does not know,&rdquo;
       she went on in a whisper. &ldquo;He is a friend of mine, and I asked him one
      day. She came from Paris, he told me. She may be American, she may be
      Belgian, or she may be English. She speaks English and French so well that
      nobody can tell her true nationality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she makes money at the tables,&rdquo; said the American woman in the
      well-cut coat and skirt and small hat. She came from Chelsea, Mass., and
      it was her first visit to what her pious father had always referred to as
      the plague spot of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money!&rdquo; exclaimed the old woman. &ldquo;Money! <i>Dieu!</i> She has losses, it
      is true, but oh!&mdash;what she wins! I only wish I had ten per cent of
      it. I should then be rich. Mine is a poor game, madame&mdash;waiting for
      someone to buy my seat instead of standing the whole afternoon. You see,
      there is only one row of chairs all around. So if a smart woman wants to
      play, some man always buys her a chair&mdash;and that is how I live. Ah!
      madame, life is a great game here in the Principality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile young Hugh Henfrey, who had travelled from London to the Riviera
      and identified the mysterious mademoiselle, had passed with his friend,
      Walter Brock, through the atrium and out into the afternoon sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they turned upon the broad gravelled terrace in front of the great
      white facade of the Casino amid the palms, the giant geraniums and mimosa,
      the sapphire Mediterranean stretched before them. Below, beyond the
      railway line which is the one blemish to the picturesque scene, out upon
      the point in the sea the constant pop-pop showed that the tir-aux-pigeons
      was in progress; while up and down the terrace, enjoying the quiet silence
      of the warm winter sunshine with the blue hills of the Italian coast to
      the left, strolled a gay, irresponsible crowd&mdash;the cosmopolitans of
      the world: politicians, financiers, merchants, princes, authors, and
      artists&mdash;the crowd which puts off its morals as easily as it discards
      its fur coats and its silk hats, and which lives only for gaiety and
      without thought of the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down,&rdquo; suggested Hugh wearily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that she&rsquo;s the same
      woman&mdash;absolutely certain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite confident you have made no mistake&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, my dear Walter. I&rsquo;d know that woman among ten thousand. I only
      know that her surname is Ferad. Her Christian name I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you suspect that she knows the secret of your father&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that she does,&rdquo; replied the good-looking young Englishman.
      &ldquo;But it is a secret she will, I fear, never reveal, unless&mdash;unless I
      compel her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how can you compel her?&rdquo; asked the elder of the two men, whose dark
      hair was slightly tinged with grey. &ldquo;It is difficult to compel a woman to
      do anything,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to know the truth!&rdquo; cried Hugh Henfrey fiercely, a look of
      determination in his eyes. &ldquo;That woman knows the true story of my father&rsquo;s
      death, and I&rsquo;ll make her reveal it. By gad&mdash;I will! I mean it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rash, Hugh,&rdquo; urged the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rash!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that when my father died so suddenly I had an
      amazing surprise. My father was a very curious man. I always thought him
      to be on the verge of bankruptcy and that the Manor and the land might be
      sold up any day. When old Charman, the solicitor, read the will, I found
      that my father had a quarter of a million lying at the bank, and that he
      had left it all to me&mdash;provided I married Louise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why not marry her?&rdquo; queried Brock lazily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always so
      mysterious, my dear Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&mdash;because I love Dorise Ranscomb. But Louise interests me, and
      I&rsquo;m worried on her account because of that infernal fellow Charles Benton.
      Louise poses as his adopted daughter. Benton is a bachelor of forty-five,
      and, according to his story, he adopted Louise when she was a child and
      put her to school. Her parentage is a mystery. After leaving school she at
      first went to live with a Mrs. Sheldon, a young widow, in an expensive
      suite in Queen Anne&rsquo;s Mansions, Westminster. After that she has travelled
      about with friends and has, I believe, been abroad quite a lot. I&rsquo;ve
      nothing against Louise, except&mdash;well, except for the strange uncanny
      influence which that man Benton has over her. I hate the fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see! And as you cannot yet reach Woodthorpe and your father&rsquo;s fortune,
      except by marrying Louise&mdash;which you don&rsquo;t intend to do&mdash;what
      are you going to do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, I intend that this woman they call &lsquo;Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo,&rsquo; 
      the lucky woman who is a decoy of the Administration of the Bains de Mer,
      shall tell me the true circumstance of my father&rsquo;s death. If I know them&mdash;then
      my hand will be strengthened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile you love Lady Ranscomb&rsquo;s daughter, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I love Dorise with all my heart. She, of course, knows nothing of
      the conditions of the will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence of some moments, interrupted only by the pop-pop of
      the pigeon-shots below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away across the white balustrade of the broad magnificent terrace the calm
      sapphire sea was deepening as the winter afternoon drew in. An engine
      whistled&mdash;that of the flower train which daily travels express from
      Cannes to Boulogne faster than the passenger train-deluxe, and bearing
      mimosa, carnations, and violets from the Cote d&rsquo;Azur to Covent Garden, and
      to the florists&rsquo; shops in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never told me the exact circumstances of your father&rsquo;s death,
      Hugh,&rdquo; remarked Brock at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exact circumstances? Ah! That&rsquo;s what I want to know. Only that woman
      knows the secret,&rdquo; answered the young man. &ldquo;All I know is that the poor
      old guv&rsquo;-nor was called up to London by an urgent letter. We had a
      shooting party at Woodthorpe and he left me in charge, saying that he had
      some business in London and might return on the following night&mdash;or
      he might be away a week. Days passed and he did not return. Several
      letters came for him which I kept in the library. I was surprised that he
      neither wrote nor returned, when, suddenly, ten days later, we had a
      telegram from the London police informing me that my father was lying in
      St. George&rsquo;s Hospital. I dashed up to town, but when I arrived I found him
      dead. At the inquest, evidence was given to show that at half-past two in
      the morning a constable going along Albemarle Street found him in evening
      dress lying huddled up in a doorway. Thinking him intoxicated, he tried to
      rouse him, but could not. A doctor who was called pronounced that he was
      suffering from some sort of poisoning. He was taken to St. George&rsquo;s
      Hospital in an ambulance, but he never recovered. The post-mortem
      investigation showed a small scratch on the palm of the hand. That scratch
      had been produced by a pin or a needle which had been infected by one of
      the newly discovered poisons which, administered secretly, give a
      post-mortem appearance of death from heart disease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your father was murdered&mdash;eh?&rdquo; exclaimed the elder man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly he was. And that woman is aware of the whole circumstances
      and of the identity of the assassin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a letter I afterwards opened&mdash;one that had been addressed to him
      at Woodthorpe in his absence. It was anonymous, written in bad English, in
      an illiterate hand, warning him to &lsquo;beware of that woman you know&mdash;Mademoiselle
      of Monte Carlo.&rsquo; It bore the French stamp and the postmark of Tours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew all this,&rdquo; Brock said. &ldquo;You are quite right, Hugh! The whole
      affair is a tangled mystery. But the first point we must establish before
      we commence to investigate is&mdash;who is Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      SECOND CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CONCERNS A GUILTY SECRET
    </h3>
    <p>
      Just after seven o&rsquo;clock that same evening young Henfrey and his friend
      Brock met in the small lounge of the Hotel des Palmiers, a rather obscure
      little establishment in the Avenue de la Costa, behind the Gardens, much
      frequented by the habitues of the Rooms who know Monte Carlo and prefer
      the little place to life at the Paris, the Hermitage, and the Riviera
      Palace, or the Gallia, up at Beausoleil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Palmiers was a place where one met a merry cosmopolitan crowd, but
      where the cocotte in her bright plumage was absent&mdash;an advantage
      which only the male habitue of Monte Carlo can fully realize. The eternal
      feminine is always so very much in evidence around the Casino, and the
      most smartly dressed woman whom one might easily take for the wife of an
      eminent politician or financier will deplore her bad luck and beg for &ldquo;a
      little loan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh as his friend came down from his room to the lounge, &ldquo;I
      suppose we ought to be going&mdash;eh? Dorise said half-past seven, and
      we&rsquo;ll just get across to the Metropole in time. Lady Ranscomb is always
      awfully punctual at home, and I expect she carries out her time-table
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men put on light overcoats over their dinner-jackets and strolled
      in the warm dusk across the Gardens and up the Galerie, with its expensive
      little shops, past the original Ciro&rsquo;s to the Metropole.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the big hall they were greeted by a well-preserved, grey-haired
      Englishwoman, Lady Ranscomb, the widow of old Sir Richard Ranscomb, who
      had been one of the greatest engineers and contractors of modern times. He
      had begun life as a small jerry-builder at Golder&rsquo;s Green, and had ended
      it a millionaire and a knight. Lady Ranscomb was seated at a little wicker
      table with her daughter Dorise, a dainty, fair-haired girl with intense
      blue eyes, who was wearing a rather daring jazzing gown of pale-blue, the
      scantiness of which a year or two before would have been voted quite
      beyond the pale for a lady, and yet in our broad-minded to-day, the day of
      undressing on the stage and in the home, it was nothing more than &ldquo;smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mother and daughter greeted the two men enthusiastically, and at Lady
      Ranscomb&rsquo;s orders the waiter brought them small glasses of an aperitif.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been all day motoring up to the Col di Tenda. Sospel is lovely!&rdquo;
       declared Dorise&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;Have you ever been there?&rdquo; she asked of Brock,
      who was an habitue of the Riviera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once and only once. I motored from Nice across to Turin,&rdquo; was his reply.
      &ldquo;Yes. It is truly a lovely run there. The Alps are gorgeous. I like San
      Dalmazzo and the chestnut groves there,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But the frontiers are
      annoying. All those restrictions. Nevertheless, the run to Turin is one of
      the finest I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently they rose, and all four walked into the crowded <i>salle-a-manger</i>,
      where the chatter was in every European language, and the gay crowd were
      gossiping mostly of their luck or their bad fortune at the <i>tapis vert</i>.
      At Monte Carlo the talk is always of the run of sequences, the many times
      the zero-trois has turned up, and of how little one ever wins <i>en plein</i>
      on thirty-six.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who visit &ldquo;Charley&rsquo;s Mount&rdquo; for the first time all this is as
      Yiddish, but soon he or she, when initiated into the games of roulette and
      trente-et-quarante, quickly gets bitten by the fever and enters into the
      spirit of the discussions. They produce their &ldquo;records&rdquo;&mdash;printed
      cards in red and black numbers with which they have carefully pricked off
      the winning numbers with a pin as they have turned up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quartette enjoyed a costly but exquisite dinner, chatting and laughing
      the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men were friends of Lady Ranscomb and frequent visitors to her fine
      house in Mount Street. Hugh&rsquo;s father, a country landowner, had known Sir
      Richard for many years, while Walter Brock had made the acquaintance of
      Lady Ranscomb a couple of years ago in connexion with some charity in
      which she had been interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were also good friends of Dorise. Both were excellent dancers, and
      Lady Ranscomb often allowed them to take her daughter to the Grafton,
      Ciro&rsquo;s, or the Embassy. Lady Ranscomb was Hugh&rsquo;s old friend, and he and
      Dorise having been thrown together a good deal ever since the girl
      returned from Versailles after finishing her education, it was hardly
      surprising that the pair should have fallen in love with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sat opposite each other that night, the young fellow gazed into
      her wonderful blue eyes, yet, alas! with a sinking heart. How could they
      ever marry?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had about six hundred a year&mdash;only just sufficient to live upon in
      these days. His father had never put him to anything since he left
      Brasenose, and now on his death he had found that, in order to recover the
      estate, it was necessary for him to marry Louise Lambert, a girl for whom
      he had never had a spark of affection. Louise was good-looking, it was
      true, but could he sacrifice his happiness; could he ever cut himself
      adrift from Dorise for mercenary motives&mdash;in order to get back what
      was surely by right his inheritance?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, after all, as he again met Dorise&rsquo;s calm, wide-open eyes, the grim
      truth arose in his mind, as it ever did, that Lady Ranscomb, even though
      she had been so kind to him, would never allow her only daughter to marry
      a man who was not rich. Had not Dorise told him of the sly hints her
      mother had recently given her regarding a certain very wealthy man named
      George Sherrard, an eligible bachelor who lived in one of the most
      expensive flats in Park Lane, and who was being generally sought after by
      mothers with marriageable daughters. In many cases mothers&mdash;and
      especially young, good-looking widows with daughters &ldquo;on their hands&rdquo;&mdash;are
      too prone to try and get rid of them &ldquo;because my daughter makes me look so
      old,&rdquo; as they whisper to their intimates of their own age.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner all four strolled across to the Casino, presenting their
      yellow cards of admission&mdash;the monthly cards granted to those who are
      approved by the smug-looking, black-coated committee of inspection, who
      judge by one&rsquo;s appearance whether one had money to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise soon detached herself from her mother and strolled up the Rooms
      with Hugh, Lady Ranscomb and Brock following.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of them intended to play, but they were strolling prior to going to
      the opera which was beneath the same roof, and for which Lady Ranscomb had
      tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Dorise exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look over there&mdash;at that table in the corner. There&rsquo;s that
      remarkable woman they call &lsquo;Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh started, and glancing in the direction she indicated saw the handsome
      woman seated at the table staking her counters quite unconcernedly and
      entirely absorbed in the game. She was wearing a dead black dress cut
      slightly low in the neck, but half-bare shoulders, with a string of
      magnificent Chinese jade beads of that pale apple green so prized by
      connoisseurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were fixed upon the revolving wheel, for upon the number sixteen
      she had just thrown a couple of thousand franc counters. The ball dropped
      with a sudden click, the croupier announced that number five had won, and
      at once raked in the two thousand francs among others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle shrugged her shoulders and smiled faintly. Yvonne Ferad was a
      born gambler. To her losses came as easily as gains. The Administration
      knew that&mdash;and they also knew how at the little pigeon-hole where
      counters were exchanged for cheques she came often and handed over big
      sums in exchange for drafts upon certain banks, both in Paris and in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet they never worried. Her lucky play attracted others who usually lost.
      Once, a year before, a Frenchman who occupied a seat next to her daily for
      a month lost over a quarter of a million sterling, and one night threw
      himself under the Paris <i>rapide</i> at the long bridge over the Var. But
      on hearing of it the next day from a croupier Mademoiselle merely shrugged
      her shoulders, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warned him to return to Paris. The fool! It is only what I expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh looked only once across at the mysterious woman whom Dorise had
      indicated, and then drew her away. As a matter of fact he had no intention
      that mademoiselle should notice him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know of her?&rdquo; he asked in a casual way when they were on the
      other side of the great saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a Frenchman I met in the hotel the day before yesterday told me all
      sorts of queer stories about her,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s apparently a
      most weird person, and she has uncanny good luck at the tables. He said
      that she had won a large fortune during the last couple of years or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh made no remark as to the reason of his visit to the Riviera, for,
      indeed, he had arrived only the day previously, and she had welcomed him
      joyously. Little did she dream that her lover had come out from London to
      see that woman who was declared to be so notorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed her playing this afternoon,&rdquo; Hugh said a moment later in a
      quiet reflective tone. &ldquo;What do the gossips really say about her, Dorise?
      All this is interesting. But there are so many interesting people here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the man who told me about her was sitting with me outside the Cafe
      de Paris when she passed across the Place to the Casino. That caused him
      to make the remarks. He said that her past was obscure. Some people say
      that she was a Danish opera singer, others declare that she was the
      daughter of a humble tobacconist in Marseilles, and others assert that she
      is English. But all agree that she is a clever and very dangerous woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why dangerous?&rdquo; inquired Hugh in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That I don&rsquo;t know. The man who told me merely hinted at her past
      career, and added that she was quite a respectable person nowadays in her
      affluence. But&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; added the girl with a laugh, &ldquo;I
      suppose people gossip about everyone in this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was your informant?&rdquo; asked her lover, much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Courtin. I believe he is an official of one of the
      departments of the Ministry of Justice in Paris. At least somebody said so
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then he probably knew more about her than he told you, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, for he warned my mother and myself against making her
      acquaintance,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;He said she was a most undesirable person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Lady Ranscomb and Walter Brock joined them, whereupon the
      former exclaimed to her daughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see that woman over there?&mdash;still playing&mdash;the woman in
      black and the jade beads, against whom Monsieur Courtin warned us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother, I noticed her. I&rsquo;ve just been telling Hugh about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mysterious person&mdash;eh?&rdquo; laughed Hugh with well-affected
      indifference. &ldquo;But one never knows who&rsquo;s who in Monte Carlo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mademoiselle is apparently something of a mystery,&rdquo; remarked Brock.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her here before several times. Once, about two years ago, I
      heard that she was mixed up in a very celebrated criminal case, but
      exactly what it was the man who told me could not recollect. She is,
      however, one of the handsomest women in the Rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And one of the wealthiest&mdash;if report be true,&rdquo; said Lady Ranscomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She fascinates me,&rdquo; Dorise declared. &ldquo;If Monsieur Courtin had not warned
      us I should most probably have spoken to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, you must do no such thing!&rdquo; cried her mother, horrified. &ldquo;It
      was extremely kind of monsieur to give us the hint. He has probably seen
      how unconventional you are, Dorise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, as they strolled on into the farther room, the conversation
      dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they&rsquo;ve heard about Mademoiselle, it seems!&rdquo; remarked Brock to his
      friend as they walked back to the Palmiers together in the moonlight after
      having seen Lady Ranscomb and her daughter to their hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled the other. &ldquo;I wish we could get hold of that Monsieur
      Courtin. He might tell us a bit about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if he would. These French officials are always close as oysters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, I will try and make his acquaintance at the Metropole
      to-morrow,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm in trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he called again at the Metropole before the ladies were
      about, but to his chagrin, he learnt from the blue-and-gold concierge that
      Monsieur Courtin, of the Ministry of Justice, had left at ten-fifteen
      o&rsquo;clock on the previous night by the <i>rapide</i> for Paris. He had been
      recalled urgently, and a special <i>coupe-lit</i> had been reserved for
      him from Ventimiglia.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day Hugh Henfrey wandered about the well-kept palm-lined gardens with
      their great beds of geraniums, carnations and roses. Brock had accepted
      the invitation of a bald-headed London stock-broker he knew to motor over
      to lunch and tennis at the Beau Site, at Cannes, while Dorise and her
      mother had gone with some people to lunch at the Reserve at Beaulieu, one
      of the best and yet least pretentious restaurants in all Europe, only
      equalled perhaps by Capsa&rsquo;s, in Bucharest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! If she would only tell!&rdquo; Hugh muttered fiercely to himself as he
      walked alone and self-absorbed. His footsteps led him out of Monte Carlo
      and up the winding road which runs to La Turbie, above the beautiful bay.
      Ever and anon powerful cars climbing the hill smothered him in white dust,
      yet he heeded them not. He was too full of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he kept on repeating to himself. &ldquo;If she would only tell the truth&mdash;if
      she would only tell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey had not travelled to Monte Carlo without much careful
      reflection and many hours of wakefulness. He intended to clear up the
      mystery of his father&rsquo;s death&mdash;and more, the reason of that strange
      incomprehensible will which was intended to wed him to Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o&rsquo;clock that afternoon he entered the Rooms to gain another
      surreptitious look at Mademoiselle. Yes! She was there, still playing on
      as imperturbably as ever, with that half-suppressed sinister smile always
      upon her full red lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sight of her aroused his fury. Was that smile really intended for himself?
      People said she was a sphinx, but he drew his breath, and when outside the
      Casino again in the warm sunshine he halted upon the broad red-carpeted
      steps and beneath his breath said in a hard, determined tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad! She shall tell me! She shall! I&rsquo;ll compel her to speak&mdash;to tell
      me the truth&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening he wrote a note to Dorise explaining to her that he was not
      feeling very well and excusing himself from going round to the hotel. This
      he sent by hand to the Metropole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brock did not turn up at dinner. Indeed, he did not expect his friend back
      till late. So he ate his meal alone, and then went out to the Cafe de
      Paris, where for an hour he sat upon the <i>terrasse</i> smoking and
      listening to the weird music of the red-coated orchestra of Roumanian
      gipsies.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the evening, indeed, he idled, chatting with men and women he knew. <i>Carmen</i>
      was being given at the Opera opposite, but though he loved music he had no
      heart to go. The one thought obsessing him was of the handsome and
      fascinating woman who was such a mystery to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock he returned to the cafe and took a seat on the <i>terrasse</i>
      in a dark corner, in such a position that he could see anyone who entered
      or left the Casino. For half an hour he watched the people passing to and
      fro. At last, in a long jade-green coat, Mademoiselle emerged alone, and,
      crossing the gardens, made her way leisurely home on foot, as was her
      habit. Monte Carlo is not a large place, therefore there is little use for
      taxis.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was out of sight, he called the waiter to bring him a liqueur of
      old cognac, which he sipped, and then lit another cigarette. When he had
      finished it he drained the little glass, and rising, strolled in the
      direction the woman of mystery had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      A walk of ten minutes brought him to the iron gates of a great white
      villa, over the high walls of which climbing roses and geraniums and
      jasmine ran riot. The night air was heavy with their perfume. He opened
      the side gate and walked up the gravelled drive to the terrace whereon
      stood the house, commanding a wonderful view of the moon-lit Mediterranean
      and the far-off mountains of Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His ring at the door was answered by a staid elderly Italian manservant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe Mademoiselle is at home,&rdquo; Hugh said in French. &ldquo;I desire to see
      her, and also to apologize for the lateness of the hour. My visit is one
      of urgency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle sees nobody except by appointment,&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s polite but
      firm reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she will see me if you give her this card,&rdquo; answered Hugh in a
      strained, unusual voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man took it hesitatingly, glanced at it, placed it upon a silver
      salver, and, leaving the visitor standing on the mat, passed through the
      glass swing-doors into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments the servant did not reappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh, standing there, entertained just a faint suspicion that he heard a
      woman&rsquo;s shrill exclamation of surprise. And that sound emboldened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after an age it seemed, the man returned, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle will see you, Monsieur. Please come this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left his hat and stick and followed the man along a corridor richly
      carpeted in red to a door on the opposite side of the house, which the
      servant threw open and announced the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle had risen to receive him. Her countenance was, Hugh saw,
      blanched almost to the lips. Her black dress caused her pallor to be more
      apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir? Pray what do you mean by resorting to this ruse in order to
      see me? Who are you?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh was silent for a moment. Then in a hard voice he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the son of the dead man whose card is in your hands, Mademoiselle!
      And I am here to ask you a few questions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The handsome woman smiled sarcastically and shrugged her half-bare
      shoulders, her fingers trembling with her jade beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Your father is dead&mdash;is he?&rdquo; she asked with an air of
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. <i>He is dead</i>,&rdquo; Hugh said meaningly, as he glanced around the
      luxurious little room with its soft rose-shaded lights and pale-blue and
      gold decorations. On her right as she stood were long French windows which
      opened on to a balcony. One of the windows stood ajar, and it was apparent
      that when he had called she had been seated in the long wicker chair
      outside enjoying the balmy moonlight after the stifling atmosphere of the
      Rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I happen to be aware that you knew my
      father, and&mdash;that you are cognizant of certain facts concerning his
      mysterious end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; she cried, raising her voice in sudden indignation. &ldquo;What on earth do
      you mean?&rdquo; She spoke in perfect English, though he had hitherto spoken in
      French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, Mademoiselle, that I intend to know the truth,&rdquo; said Hugh, fixing
      his eyes determinedly upon hers. &ldquo;I am here to learn it from your lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be mad!&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;I know nothing of the affair. You are
      mistaken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, then, deny that you have ever met a man named Charles Benton?&rdquo;
       demanded the young fellow, raising his voice. &ldquo;Perhaps, however, that is a
      bitter memory, Mademoiselle&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strikingly handsome woman pursed her lips. There was a strange look in
      her eyes. For several moments she did not speak. It was clear that the
      sudden appearance of the dead man&rsquo;s son had utterly unnerved her. What
      could he know concerning Charles Benton? How much of the affair did he
      suspect?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have met many people, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Henfrey,&rdquo; she replied
      quietly at last. &ldquo;I may have met somebody named Benton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I see,&rdquo; the young man said. &ldquo;It is a memory that you do not wish to
      recall any more than that of my dead father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father was a good man. Benton was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then you admit knowing both of them, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; cried Hugh
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&mdash;well&mdash;I may as well admit it! Why, indeed, should I
      seek to hide the truth&mdash;<i>from you</i>,&rdquo; she said in a changed
      voice. &ldquo;Pardon me. I was very upset at receiving the card. Pardon me&mdash;will
      you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not, unless you tell me the truth concerning my father&rsquo;s death and
      his iniquitous will left concerning myself. I am here to ascertain that,
      Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said in a hard voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I tell you&mdash;what then?&rdquo; she asked with knit brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you tell me, then I am prepared to promise you on oath secrecy
      concerning yourself&mdash;provided you allow me to punish those who are
      responsible. Remember, my father died by foul means. <i>And you know it!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman faced him boldly, but she was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is a promise?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You will protect me&mdash;you will be
      silent regarding me&mdash;you swear to be so&mdash;if&mdash;if I tell you
      something. I repeat that your father was a good man. I held him in the
      highest esteem, and&mdash;and&mdash;after all&mdash;it is but right that
      you, his son, should know the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you Mademoiselle. I will protect you if you will only reveal to me
      the devilish plot which resulted in his untimely end,&rdquo; Hugh assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she knit her brows and reflected for a few moments. Then in a low,
      intense, unnatural voice she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Mr. Henfrey. I feel that, after all, my conscience would be
      relieved if I revealed to you the truth. First&mdash;well, it is no use
      denying the fact that your father was not exactly the man you and his
      friends believed him to be. He led a strange dual existence, and I will
      disclose to you one or two facts concerning his untimely end which will
      show you how cleverly devised and how cunning was the plot&mdash;how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Hugh was startled by a bright flash outside the half-open
      window, a loud report, followed by a woman&rsquo;s shrill shriek of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, next moment, ere he could rush forward to save her, Mademoiselle,
      with the truth upon her lips unuttered, staggered and fell back heavily
      upon the carpet!

    <h2>
      THIRD CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN THE NIGHT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey, startled by the sudden shot, shouted for assistance, and
      then threw himself upon his knees beside the prostrate woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a bullet wound over the right ear blood was slowly oozing and
      trickling over her white cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; he shouted loudly. &ldquo;Mademoiselle has been shot from outside!
      <i>Help!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few seconds the elderly manservant burst into the room in a state of
      intense excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; cried Hugh. &ldquo;Telephone for a doctor at once. I fear your mistress
      is dying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henfrey had placed his hand upon Mademoiselle&rsquo;s heart, but could detect no
      movement. While the servant dashed to the telephone, he listened for her
      breathing, but could hear nothing. From the wall he tore down a small
      circular mirror and held it against her mouth. There was no clouding.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was every apparent sign that the small blue wound had proved fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inform the police also!&rdquo; Hugh shouted to the elderly Italian who was at
      the telephone in the adjoining room. &ldquo;The murderer must be found!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time four female servants had entered the room where their
      mistress was lying huddled and motionless. All of them were in <i>deshabille</i>.
      Then all became excitement and confusion. Hugh left them to unloosen her
      clothing and hastened out upon the veranda whereon the assassin must have
      stood when firing the shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside in the brilliant Riviera moonlight the scent of a wealth of
      flowers greeted his nostrils. It was almost bright as day. From the
      veranda spread a wide, fairy-like view of the many lights of Monte Carlo
      and La Condamine, with the sea beyond shimmering in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veranda, he saw, led by several steps down into the beautiful garden,
      while beyond, a distance of a hundred yards, was the main gate leading to
      the roadway. The assassin, after taking careful aim and firing, had, no
      doubt, slipped along, and out of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why had Mademoiselle been shot just at the moment when she was about
      to reveal the secret of his lamented father&rsquo;s death?
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended to the garden, where he examined the bushes which cast their
      dark shadows. But all was silence. The assassin had escaped!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he hurried out into the road, but again all was silence. The only
      hope of discovering the identity of the criminal was by means of the
      police vigilance. Truth to tell, however, the police of Monte Carlo are
      never over anxious to arrest a criminal, because Monte Carlo attracts the
      higher criminal class of both sexes from all over Europe. If the police of
      the Principality were constantly making arrests it would be bad
      advertisement for the Rooms. Hence, though the Monte Carlo police are
      extremely vigilant and an expert body of officers, they prefer to watch
      and to give information to the bureaux of police of other countries, so
      that arrests invariably take place beyond the frontiers of the
      Principality of Monaco.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before Doctor Leneveu, a short, stout, bald-headed little
      man, well known to habitues of the Rooms, among whom he had a large
      practice, entered the house of Mademoiselle and was greeted by Hugh. The
      latter briefly explained the tragic circumstances, whereupon the little
      doctor at once became fussy and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having ordered everyone out of the room except Henfrey, he bent and made
      an examination of the prostrate woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the unfortunate lady has certainly been shot at
      close quarters. The wound is, I tell you at once, extremely dangerous,&rdquo; he
      added, after a searching investigation. &ldquo;But she is still alive,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;she is still breathing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still alive!&rdquo; gasped Henfrey. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s excellent! I&mdash;I feared that
      she was dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She still breathes,&rdquo; the doctor replied. &ldquo;But, tell me exactly what
      has occurred. First, however, we will get them to remove her upstairs. I
      will telephone to my colleague Duponteil, and we will endeavour to extract
      the bullet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will she recover, doctor?&rdquo; asked Hugh eagerly in French. &ldquo;What do you
      think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man became serious and shook his head gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! m&rsquo;sieur, that I cannot say,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;She is in a very grave
      state&mdash;very! And the brain may be affected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh held his breath. <i>Surely Yvonne Ferad was not to die with the
      secret upon her lips!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the doctor&rsquo;s orders the servants were about to remove their mistress to
      her room when two well-dressed men of official aspect entered. They were
      officers of the Bureau of Police.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried the elder, who was the one in authority, a tall,
      lantern-jawed man with a dark brown beard and yellow teeth. &ldquo;Do not touch
      that lady! What has happened here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh came forward, and in his best French explained the circumstances of
      the tragedy&mdash;how Mademoiselle had been shot in his presence by an
      unknown hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The assassin, whoever he was, stood out yonder&mdash;upon the veranda&mdash;but
      I never saw him,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It was all over in a second&mdash;and he has
      escaped!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray who are you?&rdquo; demanded the police officer bluntly. &ldquo;Please
      explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh was rather nonplussed. The question required explanation, no doubt.
      It would, he saw, appear very curious that he should visit Mademoiselle of
      Monte Carlo at that late hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;well, I called upon Mademoiselle because I wished to obtain some
      important information from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What information? Rather late for a call, surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young Englishman hesitated. Then, with true British grit, he assumed
      an attitude of boldness, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I compelled to answer that question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Charles Ogier, chief inspector of the Surete of Monaco, and I press
      for a reply,&rdquo; answered the other firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, Hugh Henfrey, a British subject, at present decline to satisfy
      you,&rdquo; was the young man&rsquo;s bold response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the lady still alive?&rdquo; inquired the inspector of Doctor Leneveu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have ordered her to be taken up to her room&mdash;of course, when
      m&rsquo;sieur the inspector gives permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ogier looked at the deathly countenance with the closed eyes, and noted
      that the wound in the skull had been bound up with a cotton handkerchief
      belonging to one of the maids. Mademoiselle&rsquo;s dark well-dressed hair had
      become unbound and was straying across her face, while her handsome gown
      had been torn in the attempt to unloosen her corsets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the police officer; &ldquo;they had better take her upstairs. We
      will remain here and make inquiries. This is a very queer affair&mdash;to
      say the least,&rdquo; he added, glancing suspiciously at Henfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the servants carried their unconscious mistress tenderly upstairs,
      the fussy little doctor went to the telephone to call Doctor Duponteil,
      the principal surgeon of Monaco. He had hesitated whether to take the
      victim to the hospital, but had decided that the operation could be done
      just as effectively upstairs. So, after speaking to Duponteil, he also
      spoke to the sister at the hospital, asking her to send up two nurses
      immediately to the Villa Amette.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Inspector Ogier was closely questioning the young
      Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like everyone in Monte Carlo he knew the mysterious Mademoiselle by sight.
      More than once the suspicions of the police had been aroused against her.
      Indeed, in the archives of the Prefecture there reposed a bulky dossier
      containing reports of her doings and those of her friends. Yet there had
      never been anything which would warrant the authorities to forbid her from
      remaining in the Principality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tragedy, therefore, greatly interested Ogier and his colleague. Both
      of them had spent many years in the service of the Paris Surete under the
      great Goron before being appointed to the responsible positions in the
      detective service of Monaco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you knew the lady?&rdquo; Ogier asked of the young man who was naturally
      much upset over the startling affair, and the more so because the secret
      of his father&rsquo;s mysterious death had been filched from him by the hand of
      some unknown assassin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did not know her personally,&rdquo; Henfrey replied somewhat lamely. &ldquo;I
      came to call upon her, and she received me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you call at this hour? Could you not have called in the daytime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle was in the Rooms until late,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then you followed her home&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police officer pursed his lips and raised his eyes significantly at
      his colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was actually happening when the shot was fired? Describe it to
      me, please,&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was standing just here&rdquo;&mdash;and he crossed the room and stood upon
      the spot where he had been&mdash;&ldquo;Mademoiselle was over there beside the
      window. I had my back to the window. She was about to tell me something&mdash;to
      answer a question I had put to her&mdash;when someone from outside shot
      her through the open glass door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you did not see her assailant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw nothing. The shot startled me, and, seeing her staggering, I rushed
      to her. In the meantime the assailant&mdash;whoever he was&mdash;disappeared!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brown-bearded man smiled dubiously. As he stood beneath the electric
      light Hugh saw doubt written largely upon his countenance. He instantly
      realized that Ogier disbelieved his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all it was a very lame one. He would not fully admit the reason of
      his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; exclaimed the police officer. &ldquo;It seems
      extraordinary that any person should creep along this veranda.&rdquo; And he
      walked out and looked about in the moonlight. &ldquo;If the culprit wished to
      shoot Mademoiselle in secret, then he would surely not have done so in
      your presence. He might easily have shot her as she was on her way home.
      The road is lonely up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the Englishman. &ldquo;The whole affair is, to me,
      a complete mystery. I saw nobody. But it was plain to me that when I
      called Mademoiselle was seated out upon the veranda. Look at her chair&mdash;and
      the cushions! It was very hot and close in the Rooms to-night, and
      probably she was enjoying the moonlight before retiring to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite possibly,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;But that does not alter the fact that the
      assassin ran considerable risk in coming along the veranda in the full
      moonlight and firing through the open door. Are you quite certain that
      Mademoiselle&rsquo;s assailant was outside&mdash;and not inside?&rdquo; he asked, with
      a queer expression upon his aquiline face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh saw that he was hinting at his suspicion that he himself had shot
      her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite certain,&rdquo; he assured him. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my own reasons,&rdquo; replied the police officer with a hard laugh.
      &ldquo;Now, tell me what do you know about Mademoiselle Ferad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you call upon her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you. I desired some information, and she was about to give it
      to me when the weapon was fired by an unknown hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unknown&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Unknown to me. It might be known to Mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was this information you so urgently desired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some important information. I travelled from London to Monte Carlo in
      order to obtain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then you had a motive in coming here&mdash;some strong motive, I take
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. A very strong motive. I wanted her to clear up certain mysterious
      happenings in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ogier was instantly alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happenings?&rdquo; he asked, for he recollected the big dossier and the
      suspicions extending over four or five years concerning the real identity
      and mode of life of the handsome, sphinx-like woman Yvonne Ferad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey was silent for a few moments. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happenings in London that&mdash;well, that I do not wish to recall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ogier again looked him straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggest, M&rsquo;sieur Henfrey&rdquo;&mdash;for Hugh had given him his name&mdash;&ldquo;I
      suggest that you have been attracted by Mademoiselle as so many other men
      have been. She seems to exercise a fatal influence upon some people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;I have heard lots of things about her. Her success
      at the tables is constant and uncanny. Even the Administration are
      interested in her winnings, and are often filled with wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, m&rsquo;sieur. She keeps herself apart. She is a mysterious person&mdash;the
      most remarkable in all the Principality. We, at the Bureau, have heard all
      sorts of curious stories concerning her&mdash;once it was rumoured that
      she was the daughter of a reigning European sovereign. Then we take all
      the reports with the proverbial grain of salt. That Mademoiselle is a
      woman of outstanding intellect and courage, as well as of great beauty,
      cannot be denied. Therefore I tell you that I am intensely interested in
      this attempt upon her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;I have a strong reason to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you tell me that reason?&rdquo; inquired the officer of the Surete,
      still looking at him very shrewdly. &ldquo;Why fence with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henfrey hesitated. Then he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a purely personal matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, you have said that you were not acquainted with Mademoiselle!&rdquo;
       remarked Ogier suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite true. The first time I have spoken to her was this evening,
      a few minutes before the attempt was made upon her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your theory is that while you stood in conversation with her
      somebody crept along the veranda and shot her&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ogier smiled sarcastically, and turning to his colleague, ordered him to
      search the room. The inspector evidently suspected the young Englishman of
      having shot Mademoiselle, and the search was in order to try and discover
      the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the brown-bearded officer called the Italian manservant, who
      gave his name as Giulio Cataldi, and who stated that he had been in
      Mademoiselle Ferad&rsquo;s service a little over five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen this Englishman before?&rdquo; Ogier asked, indicating Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, until to-night, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He called about twenty
      minutes after Mademoiselle&rsquo;s return from the Rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mademoiselle quarrelled with anybody of late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to my knowledge, m&rsquo;sieur. She is of a very quiet and even
      disposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anyone you know who might possess a motive to shoot her?&rdquo; asked
      Ogier. &ldquo;The crime has not been committed with a motive of robbery, but
      either out of jealousy or revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of nobody,&rdquo; declared the highly respectable Italian, whose
      moustache was tinged with grey. He shrugged his shoulders and showed his
      palms as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle arrived here two months ago, I believe?&rdquo; queried the police
      official.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, m&rsquo;sieur. She spent the autumn in Paris, and during the summer she
      was at Deauville. She also went to London for a brief time, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she ever live in London?&rdquo; asked Hugh eagerly, interrupting Ogier&rsquo;s
      interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;once. She had a furnished house on the Cromwell Road for about
      six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago?&rdquo; asked Henfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please allow me to make my inquiries, monsieur!&rdquo; exclaimed the detective
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the question I ask is of greatest importance to me in my own
      inquiries,&rdquo; Hugh persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here to discover the identity of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s assailant,&rdquo; Ogier
      asserted. &ldquo;And I will not brook your interference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle has been shot, and it is for you to discover who fired at
      her,&rdquo; snapped the young Englishman. &ldquo;I consider that I have just as much
      right to put a question to this man as you have, that is&rdquo;&mdash;he added
      with sarcasm&mdash;&ldquo;that is, of course, if you don&rsquo;t suspect him of
      shooting his mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I certainly do not suspect that,&rdquo; the Frenchman said. &ldquo;But, to tell
      you candidly, your story of the affair strikes me as a very improbable
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; laughed Hugh, &ldquo;I thought so! You suspect me&mdash;eh? Very well.
      Where is the weapon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have hidden it,&rdquo; suggested the other meaningly. &ldquo;We shall, no
      doubt, find it somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will, and that will lead to the arrest of the guilty person,&rdquo;
       Hugh laughed. Then he was about to put further questions to the man
      Cataldi when Doctor Leneveu entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; demanded Hugh breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countenance of the fussy little doctor fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said in a low earnest voice, &ldquo;I much fear that Mademoiselle
      will not recover. My colleague Duponteil concurs with that view. We have
      done our best, but neither of us entertain any hope that she will live!&rdquo;
       Then turning to Ogier, the doctor exclaimed: &ldquo;This is an amazing affair&mdash;especially
      in face of what is whispered concerning the unfortunate lady. What do you
      make of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer of the Surete knit his brows, and with frankness replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present I am entirely mystified&mdash;entirely mystified!&rdquo;

      FOURTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHAT THE DOSSIER CONTAINED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Walter Brock was awakened at four o&rsquo;clock that morning by Hugh touching
      him upon the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started up in bed and staring at his friend&rsquo;s pale, haggard face
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&mdash;why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo has been shot!&rdquo; the other replied in a hard
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shot!&rdquo; gasped Brock, startled. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Briefly Hugh who had only just entered the hotel, explained the curious
      circumstances&mdash;how, just at the moment she had been about to reveal
      the secret of his father&rsquo;s death she was shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most extraordinary!&rdquo; declared his friend. &ldquo;Surely, we have not been
      followed here by someone who is determined to prevent you from knowing the
      truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems much like it, Walter,&rdquo; replied the younger man very seriously.
      &ldquo;There must be some strong motive or no person would dare to shoot her
      right before my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed. Somebody who is concerned in your father&rsquo;s death has adopted this
      desperate measure in order to prevent Mademoiselle from telling you the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly my opinion, my dear Walter. If it was a crime for gain, or
      through motives of either jealousy or revenge, Mademoiselle would
      certainly have been attacked on her way home. The road is quite deserted
      towards the crest of the hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do the police say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not appear to trouble to track Mademoiselle&rsquo;s assailant. They say
      they will wait until daylight before searching for footprints on the
      gravel outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! They are not very fond of making arrests within the Principality.
      It&rsquo;s such a bad advertisement for the Rooms. The Administration like to
      show a clean sheet as regards serious crime. Our friends here leave it to
      the French or Italian police to deal with the criminals so that the
      Principality shall prove itself the most honest State in Europe,&rdquo; Brock
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police, I believe, suspect me of shooting her,&rdquo; said Hugh bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very awkward. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;they don&rsquo;t know the true reason I went to see her, or they
      would never believe me to be guilty of a crime so much against my own
      interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brock, who was still sitting up in bed in his pale blue silk pyjamas,
      reflected a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Hugh,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;after all it is only natural that they
      should believe that you had a hand in the matter. Even though she told you
      the truth, it is quite within reason that you should have suddenly become
      incensed against her for the part she must have played in your father&rsquo;s
      mysterious death, and in a frenzy of anger you shot her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh drew a long breath, and his eyebrows narrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I had never regarded it in that light before!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;But
      what about the weapon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might easily have hidden it before the arrival of the police. You
      admit that you went out on the veranda. Therefore if they do chance to
      find the weapon in the garden then their suspicions will, no doubt, be
      considerably increased. It&rsquo;s a pity, old man, that you didn&rsquo;t make a clean
      breast of the motive of your visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I now see my horrible mistake,&rdquo; Henfrey admitted. &ldquo;I thought myself wise
      to preserve silence, to know nothing, and now I see quite plainly that I
      have only brought suspicion unduly upon myself. The police, however, know
      Yvonne Ferad to be a somewhat mysterious person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which renders the situation only worse,&rdquo; Brock said. Then, after a pause,
      he added: &ldquo;Now that you have declined to tell the police why you visited
      the Villa Amette and have, in a way, defied them, it will be best to
      maintain that attitude. Tell them nothing, no matter what happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to pursue that course. But the worst of it is, Walter, that the
      doctors hold out no hope of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s recovery. I saw Duponteil half
      an hour ago, and he told me that he could give me no encouraging
      information. The bullet has been extracted, but she is hovering between
      life and death. I suppose it will be in the papers to-morrow, and Dorise
      and her mother will know of my nocturnal visit to the house of a notorious
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that worry you, my dear chap. Here, they keep the news of all
      tragedies out of the papers, because shooting affairs may be thought by
      the public to be due to losses at the Rooms. Recollect that of all the
      suicides here&mdash;the dozens upon dozens of poor ruined gamesters who
      are yearly laid to rest in the Suicides&rsquo; Cemetery&mdash;not a single
      report has appeared in any newspaper. So I think you may remain assured
      that Lady Ranscomb and her daughter will not learn anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sincerely hope they won&rsquo;t, otherwise it will go very hard with me,&rdquo;
       Hugh said in a low, intense voice. &ldquo;Ah! What a night it has been for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if Mademoiselle dies the assailant, whoever he was, will be guilty of
      wilful murder; while you, on your part, will never know the truth
      concerning your father&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; remarked the elder man, running his
      fingers through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That is the position of this moment. But further, I am suspected of
      the crime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brock dressed while his friend sat upon the edge of the bed, pale-faced
      and agitated. Suppose that the assailant had flung his pistol into the
      bushes, and the police eventually discovered it? Then, no doubt, he would
      be put across the frontier to be arrested by the police of the Department
      of the Alpes Maritimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, the situation was most serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together the two men strolled out into the early morning air and sat upon
      a seat on the terrace of the Casino watching the sun as it rose over the
      tideless sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly an hour they sat discussing the affair; then they ascended the
      white, dusty road to the beautiful Villa Amette, the home of the
      mysterious Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Giulio Cataldi opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! m&rsquo;sieur, Mademoiselle is just the same,&rdquo; he replied in response to
      Hugh&rsquo;s eager inquiry. &ldquo;The police have gone, but Doctor Leneveu is still
      upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the police searched the garden?&rdquo; inquired Hugh eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, m&rsquo;sieur. They made a thorough examination, but have discovered no
      marks of footprints except those of yourself, myself, and a tradesman&rsquo;s
      lad who brought up a parcel late last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they found no weapon?&rdquo; asked the young Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, m&rsquo;sieur. There is no clue whatever to the assailant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious that there should be no footmarks,&rdquo; remarked Brock. &ldquo;Yet they
      found yours, Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The man must surely have left some trace outside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would certainly have thought so,&rdquo; Brock said. &ldquo;I wonder if we may go
      into the room where the tragedy happened?&rdquo; he asked of the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; was the courteous reply, and he conducted them both
      into the apartment wherein Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo had been shot down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you accompany Mademoiselle when she went to London, Giulio?&rdquo; asked
      young Henfrey of the old Italian, after he had described to Brock exactly
      what had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I was at Cromwell Road for a short time. But
      I do not care for London, so Mademoiselle sent me back here to look after
      the Villa because old Jean, the concierge, had been taken to the
      hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When in London you knew some of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s friends, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few&mdash;only a few,&rdquo; was the Italian&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever know a certain Mr. Benton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old fellow shook his head blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to my knowledge, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Mademoiselle had really very
      few friends in London. There was a Mrs. Matthews and her husband,
      Americans whom she met here in Monte Carlo, and Sir George Cave-Knight,
      who died a few weeks ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember an elderly gentleman named Henfrey calling?&rdquo; asked Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cataldi reflected for a moment, and then answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name sounds familiar to me, m&rsquo;sieur, but in what connexion I cannot
      recollect. That is your name, is it not?&rdquo; he asked, remembering the card
      he had taken to his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Hugh replied. &ldquo;I have reason to believe that my late father was
      acquainted with your mistress, and that he called upon her in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that a gentleman named Henfrey did call, because when I glanced
      at the card you gave me last night the name struck me as familiar,&rdquo; the
      servant said. &ldquo;But whether he actually called, or whether someone at table
      mentioned his name I really cannot recollect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; exclaimed Hugh with a sigh. &ldquo;As a matter of fact it
      was in order to make certain inquiries regarding my late father that I
      called upon Mademoiselle last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giulio Cataldi turned in pretence of rearranging a chair, but in reality
      to avert his face from the young man&rsquo;s gaze&mdash;a fact which Hugh did
      not fail to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he really told the truth when he declared that he could not recollect
      his father calling?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long were you in London with Mademoiselle?&rdquo; asked Henfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About six weeks&mdash;not longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it because of some untoward occurrence that the old Italian did not
      like London, Hugh wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are quite sure that you do not recollect my father calling upon
      your mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I have said, m&rsquo;sieur, I do not remember. Yet I recall the name, as it
      is a rather unusual one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have never heard of Mr. Benton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cataldi shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Hugh went on, &ldquo;tell me whether you entertain any suspicions of
      anyone who might be tempted to kill your mistress. Mademoiselle has
      enemies, has she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; exclaimed the man with the grey moustache and small, black
      furtive eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone has enemies of one sort or another,&rdquo; Walter remarked. &ldquo;And no
      doubt Mademoiselle has. It is for us to discover the enemy who shot her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, it is, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; exclaimed the servant. &ldquo;The poor Signorina! I
      do hope that the police will discover who tried to kill her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For aught we know the attempt upon the lady&rsquo;s life may prove successful
      after all,&rdquo; said Hugh despairingly. &ldquo;The doctors hold out no hope of her
      recovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. A third doctor has been in consultation&mdash;Doctor Bazin, from
      Beaulieu. He only left a quarter of an hour ago. He told me that the poor
      Signorina cannot possibly live! Ah! messieurs, how terrible all this is&mdash;<i>povera
      Signorina</i>! She was always so kind and considerate to us all.&rdquo; And the
      old man&rsquo;s voice trembled with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter Brock gazed around the luxurious room and at the long open window
      through which streamed the bright morning sun, with the perfume of the
      flowers outside. What was the mystery concerning Mademoiselle Yvonne? What
      foundation had the gossips for those constant whisperings which had
      rendered the handsome woman so notorious?
    </p>
    <p>
      True, the story of the death of Hugh&rsquo;s father was an unusually strange
      one, curious in every particular&mdash;and stranger still that the secret
      was held by this beautiful, but mysterious, woman who lived in such
      luxury, and who gambled so recklessly and with invariable good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked back to the town Hugh&rsquo;s heart sank within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will die,&rdquo; he muttered bitterly to himself. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll die, and I shall
      never learn the truth of the poor guv&rsquo;nor&rsquo;s sad end, or the reason why I
      am being forced to marry Louise Lambert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an iniquitous will, Hugh!&rdquo; declared his friend. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s infernally
      hard on you that just at the very moment when you could have learnt the
      truth that shot was fired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the woman had any hand in my father&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; Hugh asked.
      &ldquo;Do you think that she had repented, and was about to try and atone for
      what she had done by confessing the whole affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That is just the view I take,&rdquo; answered Brock. &ldquo;Of course, we have
      no idea what part she played in the business. But my idea is that she
      alone knows the reason why this marriage with Louise is being forced upon
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, then, it seems more than likely that I&rsquo;ve been followed
      here to Monte Carlo, and my movements watched. But why has she been shot?
      Why did not her enemies shoot me? They could have done so twenty times
      during the past few days. Perhaps the shot which hit her was really
      intended for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. There is a monetary motive behind your marriage with
      Louise. If you died, your enemy would gain nothing. That seems clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who can be my secret enemy?&rdquo; asked the young man in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle alone knows that, and it was undoubtedly her intention to
      warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But if she dies I shall remain in ignorance,&rdquo; he declared in a hard
      voice. &ldquo;The whole affair is so tangled that I can see nothing clearly&mdash;only
      that my refusal to marry Louise will mean ruin to me&mdash;and I shall
      lose Dorise in the bargain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walter Brock, older and more experienced, was equally mystified. The
      pessimistic attitude of the three doctors who had attended the injured
      woman was, indeed, far from reassuring. The injury to the head caused by
      the assailant&rsquo;s bullet was, they declared, most dangerous. Indeed, the
      three medical men marvelled that she still lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men walked through the palm-lined garden, bright with flowers,
      back to their hotel, wondering whether news of the tragedy had yet got
      abroad. But they heard nothing of it, and it seemed true, as Walter Brock
      had declared, that the police make haste to suppress any tragic happenings
      in the Principality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though they were unconscious of it, a middle-aged, well-dressed Frenchman
      had, during their absence from the hotel, been making diligent inquiries
      regarding them of the night concierge and some of the staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concierge had recognized the visitor as Armand Buisson, of the police
      bureau at Nice. It seemed as though the French police were unduly
      inquisitive concerning the well-conducted young Englishman and his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as a matter of fact, half an hour after Hugh had left the Villa
      Amette, Ogier had telegraphed to Buisson in Nice, and the latter had come
      along the Corniche road in a fast car to make his own inquiries and
      observations upon the pair of Englishmen. Ogier strongly suspected Henfrey
      of firing the shot, but was, nevertheless, determined to remain inactive
      and leave the matter to the Prefecture of the Department of Alpes
      Maritimes. Hence the reason that the well-dressed Frenchman lounged in the
      hall of the hotel pretending to read the &ldquo;Phare du Littoral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just before noon Hugh went to the telephone in the hotel and inquired of
      Cataldi the progress of his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is just the same, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; came the voice in broken English. &ldquo;<i>Santa
      Madonna!</i> How terrible it all is! Doctor Leneveu has left, and Doctor
      Duponteil is now here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the police been again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, m&rsquo;sieur. Nobody has been,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Hugh rang off and crossed the hall, little dreaming that the
      well-dressed Frenchman had been highly interested in his questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later he went along to the Metropole, where he had an
      engagement to lunch with Dorise and her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they met, however, Lady Ranscomb exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hugh, you look very pale. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; he laughed forcedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very bright to-day. I think
      it was the sirocco of yesterday that has upset me a little, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, while they were seated at table, Dorise suddenly exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do you know, mother, that young French lady over yonder, Madame
      Jacomet, has just told me something. There&rsquo;s a whisper that the mysterious
      woman, Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo, was shot during the night by a
      discarded lover!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shot!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Ranscomb. &ldquo;Dear me! How very dreadful. What really
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Madame Jacomet was told by her husband, who heard it in
      Ciro&rsquo;s this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; remarked Hugh, striving to remain calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But women of her class invariably come to a bad end,&rdquo; remarked the
      widow. &ldquo;How pleased I am, Dorise, that you never spoke to her. She&rsquo;s a
      most dreadful person, they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she evidently knows how to win money at the tables, mother,&rdquo; said
      the girl, lifting her clear blue eyes to those of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But I wonder what the scandal is all about?&rdquo; said the widow of the
      great engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t trouble to inquire Lady Ranscomb,&rdquo; Hugh hastened to remark.
      &ldquo;One hears scandal on every hand in Monte Carlo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I suppose so,&rdquo; replied the elder woman, and then the subject was
      dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the ugly affair was being rumoured. It caused Hugh a good deal of
      apprehension, for he feared that his name would be associated with that of
      the mysterious Mademoiselle. Evidently one or other of the servants at the
      Villa Amette had been indiscreet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, in his private room at the bureau of police down in
      Monaco, Superintendent Ogier was carefully perusing a dossier of official
      papers which had been brought to him by the archivist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between his thin lips was a long, thin, Swiss cigar&mdash;his favorite
      smoke&mdash;and with his gold-rimmed pince-nez poised upon his aquiline
      nose he was reading a document which would certainly have been of
      considerable interest to Hugh Henfrey and his friend Walter Brock could
      they have seen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the pale yellow paper were many lines of typewriting in French&mdash;a
      carbon copy evidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was headed: &ldquo;Republique Francaise. Department of Herault. Prefecture of
      Police. Bureau of the Director of Police. Reference Number 20197.B.,&rdquo; and
      was dated nearly a year before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It commenced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copy of an &lsquo;information&rsquo; in the archives of the Prefecture of the
      Department of Herault concerning the woman Marie Mignot, or Leullier, now
      passing under the name of Yvonne Ferad and living at the Villa Amette at
      Monte Carlo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman in question was born in 1884 at Number 45 Rue des Etuves, in
      Montpellier, and was the daughter of one Doctor Rigaud, a noted
      toxicologist of the Faculty of Medicine, and curator of the University
      Library. At the age of seventeen, after her father&rsquo;s death, she became a
      school teacher at a small school in the Rue Morceau, and at nineteen
      married Charles Leullier, a good-looking young scoundrel who posed as
      being well off, but who was afterwards proved to be an expert
      international thief, a member of a gang of dangerous thieves who committed
      robberies in the European express trains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fact was unknown to the girl, therefore at first all went smoothly,
      until the wife discovered the truth and left him. She then joined the
      chorus of a revue at the Jardin de Paris, where she met a well-to-do
      Englishman named Bryant. The pair went to England, where she married him,
      and they resided in the county of Northampton. Six months later Bryant
      died, leaving her a large sum of money. In the meantime Leullier had been
      arrested by the Italian police for a daring robbery with violence in a
      train traveling between Milan and Turin and been sentenced to ten years on
      the penal island of Gorgona. His wife, hearing of this from an Englishman
      named Houghton, who, though she was unaware of it, was following the same
      profession as her husband, returned to France. She rented an apartment in
      Paris, and afterwards played at Monte Carlo, where she won a considerable
      sum, with the proceeds of which she purchased the Villa Amette, which she
      now occupies each season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extracts of reports concerning Marie Leullier, alias Yvonne Ferad, are
      herewith appended:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Criminal Investigation Department, New Scotland Yard, London&mdash;to the
      Prefecture of Police, Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Yvonne Ferad rented a furnished house at Hove, near
      Brighton, in June, 1918. Afterwards moved to Worthing and to Exeter, and
      later took a house in the Cromwell Road, London, in 1919. She was
      accompanied by an Italian manservant named Cataldi. Her conduct was
      suspicious, though she was undoubtedly possessed of considerable means.
      She was often seen at the best restaurants with various male
      acquaintances, more especially with a man named Kenworthy. Her association
      with this person, and with another man named Percy Stendall, was curious,
      as both men were habitual criminals and had served several terms of penal
      servitude each. Certain suspicions were aroused, and observation was kept,
      but nothing tangible was discovered. It is agreed, however, that some
      mystery surrounds this woman in question. She left London quite suddenly,
      but left no debts behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Information from the Borough Police Office, Worthing, to the Prefecture
      of Police, Department of Herault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Yvonne Ferad has been identified by the photograph sent as
      having lived in Worthing in December, 1918. She rented a small furnished
      house facing the sea, and was accompanied by an Italian manservant and a
      French maid. Her movements were distinctly mysterious. A serious fracas
      occurred at the house on the evening of December 18th, 1918. A middle-aged
      gentleman, whose name is unknown, called there about seven o&rsquo;clock and a
      violent quarrel ensued between the lady and her visitor, the latter being
      very seriously assaulted by the Italian. The constable on duty was called
      in, but the visitor refused to prosecute, and after having his injuries
      attended to by a doctor left for London. Three days later Mademoiselle
      disappeared from Worthing. It is believed by the Chief Constable that the
      woman is of the criminal class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Charles Ogier, inspector of the detective police of Monaco, smiled,
      laid down his cigar, and took up another and even more interesting
      document.

    <h2>
      FIFTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ON THE HOG&rsquo;S BACK
    </h3>
    <p>
      Three days later. On a cold afternoon just as the wintry light was fading
      a tall, dark, middle-aged, rather handsome man with black hair and
      moustache, and wearing a well-cut, dark-grey overcoat and green velour
      hat, alighted from the train at the wayside station of Wanborough, in
      Surrey, and inquired of the porter the way to Shapley Manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shapley, sir? Why, take the road there yonder up the hill till you get to
      the main road which runs along the Hog&rsquo;s Back from Guildford to
      Farnborough. When you get on the main road, turn sharp to the left past
      the old toll-gate, and you&rsquo;ll find the Manor on the left in among a big
      clump of trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a mile, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, the only passenger who had alighted, slipped sixpence into
      the man&rsquo;s hand, buttoned his coat, and started out to walk in the
      direction indicated, breasting the keen east wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was well-set-up, and of athletic bearing. He took long strides as with
      swinging gait he went up the hill. As he did so, he muttered to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was an infernal fool not to have come down in a car! I hate these
      beastly muddy country roads. But Molly has the telephone&mdash;so I can
      ring up for a car to fetch me&mdash;which is a consolation, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with his keen eyes set before him, he pressed forward up the steep
      incline to where, for ten miles, ran the straight broad highway over the
      high ridge known as the Hog&rsquo;s Back. The road is very popular with
      motorists, for so high is it that on either side there stretches a wide
      panorama of country, the view on the north being towards the Thames Valley
      and London, while on the south Hindhead with the South Downs in the blue
      distance show beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached the high road the stranger paused to take breath, and
      incidentally to admire the magnificent view. Indeed, an expression of
      admiration fell involuntarily from his lips. Then he went along for
      another half-mile in the teeth of the cutting wind with the twilight
      rapidly coming on, until he came to the clump of dark firs and presently
      walked up a gravelled drive to a large, but somewhat inartistic, Georgian
      house of red brick with long square windows. In parts the ivy was trying
      to hide its terribly ugly architecture for around the deep porch it grew
      thickly and spread around one corner of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ring at the door brought a young manservant whom the caller addressed as
      Arthur, and, wishing him good afternoon, asked if Mrs. Bond were at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! good,&rdquo; said the caller. &ldquo;Just tell her I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; And he proceeded to
      remove his coat and to hang it up in the great flagged hall with the air
      of one used to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Manor was a spacious, well-furnished place, full of good pictures and
      much old oak furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant passed along the corridor, and entering the drawing-room,
      announced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Benton is here, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Benton! Show him in,&rdquo; cried his mistress enthusiastically. &ldquo;Show
      him in at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next moment the caller entered the fine, old-fashioned room, where a
      well-preserved, fair-haired woman of about forty was taking her tea alone
      and petting her Pekinese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Charles? So you&rsquo;ve discovered me here, eh?&rdquo; she exclaimed, jumping
      up and taking his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Molly. And you seem to have very comfortable quarters,&rdquo; laughed
      Benton as he threw himself unceremoniously into a chintz-covered armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you&rsquo;re quite a great lady in these parts&mdash;eh?&mdash;now
      that you live at Shapley Manor. Where&rsquo;s Louise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went up to town this morning. She won&rsquo;t be back till after dinner.
      She&rsquo;s with her old school-fellow&mdash;that girl Bertha Trench.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Then we can have a chat. I&rsquo;ve several things to consult you about
      and ask your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have some tea first,&rdquo; urged his good-looking hostess, pouring him some
      into a Crown Derby cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he commenced. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve done quite well to take this place,
      as you&rsquo;ve done, for three years. You are now safely out of the way. The
      Paris Surete are making very diligent inquiries, but the Surrey
      Constabulary will never identify you with the lady of the Rue Racine. So
      you are quite safe here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of that, Charles?&rdquo; she asked, fixing her big grey eyes upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain. It was the wisest course to get back here to England, although
      you had to take a very round-about journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I got to Switzerland, then to Italy, and from Genoa took an Anchor
      Line steamer across to New York. After that I came over to Liverpool, and
      in the meantime I had become Mrs. Bond. Louise, of course, thought we were
      travelling for pleasure. I had to explain my change of name by telling her
      that I did not wish my divorced husband to know that I was back in
      England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the girl believed it, of course,&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. She believes anything I tell her,&rdquo; said the clever,
      unscrupulous woman for whom the Paris police were in active search, whose
      real name was Molly Maxwell, and whose amazing career was well known to
      the French police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only recently a sum of a quarter of a million francs had fallen into her
      hands, and with it she now rented Shapley Manor and had set up as a
      country lady. Benton gazed around the fine old room with its Adams ceiling
      and its Georgian furniture, and reflected how different were Molly&rsquo;s
      present surroundings from that stuffy little flat <i>au troisieme</i> in
      the Rue Racine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You had a very narrow escape, Molly. I dared not come
      near you, but I knew that you&rsquo;d look after the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I always look after her as though she were my own child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benton&rsquo;s lip curled as he sipped his China tea, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because so much depends upon her&mdash;eh? I&rsquo;m glad you view the
      situation from a fair and proper stand-point. We&rsquo;re now out for a big
      thing, therefore we must not allow any little hitch to prevent us from
      bringing it off successfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree, Charles. Our great asset is Louise. But she must be
      innocent of it all. She must know absolutely nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. If she had an inkling that we were forcing her to marry Hugh she
      would fiercely resent it. She&rsquo;s a girl of spirit, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Charles, I know that,&rdquo; laughed the woman. &ldquo;Ever since she came
      home from school I&rsquo;ve noticed how independent she is. She certainly has a
      will of her own. But she likes Hugh, and we must encourage it. Recollect
      that a fortune is at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not overlooked that,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;But of late I&rsquo;ve come to fear
      that we are treading upon thin ice. I don&rsquo;t like the look of affairs at
      the present moment. Young Henfrey is head over ears in love with that girl
      Dorise Ranscomb, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! It&rsquo;s only a flirtation, my dear Charles,&rdquo; laughed the woman. &ldquo;When
      just a little pressure is put upon the boy, and a sly hint to Lady
      Ranscomb, then the affair will soon be off, and he&rsquo;ll fall into Louise&rsquo;s
      arms. She&rsquo;s really very fond of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be, but he takes no notice of her. She told me so the other day.
      He&rsquo;s gone to the Riviera&mdash;followed Dorise, I suppose,&rdquo; Benton said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne wrote me a few days ago to say that he was there with a friend of
      his named Walter Brock. Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a naval lieutenant-commander who served in the war and was invalided
      out after the Battle of Jutland. He got the D.S.O. over the Falklands
      affair, and has now some post at the Admiralty. He was in command of a
      torpedo boat which sank a German cruiser, and was afterwards blown up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are both out at Monte Carlo, Yvonne says. And Henfrey is with Dorise
      daily,&rdquo; remarked the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne is always apprehensive lest young Henfrey should learn the secret
      of the old fellow&rsquo;s end,&rdquo; said Benton. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how the truth of
      the&mdash;well, rather ugly affair can ever come out, except by an
      indiscretion by one or other of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is scarcely likely, Charles, is it?&rdquo; his hostess laughed as she
      pushed across to him a big silver box of cigarettes and then reclined
      lazily among her cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It would certainly be a very sensational affair if the newspapers got
      hold of the facts, my dear Molly. But don&rsquo;t let us anticipate such a
      thing. Fortunately Louise, in her girlish innocence, knows nothing. Old
      Henfrey left his money to his son upon certain conditions, one of which is
      that Hugh shall marry Louise. And that marriage must, at all hazards, take
      place. After that, we care for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The handsome woman who was rolling a cigarette between her well-manicured
      fingers hesitated. Her countenance assumed a strange look as she
      reflected. She was far too clever to express any off-hand opinion. She had
      outwitted the police of Paris, Brussels, and Rome in turn. Her whole
      career had been a criminal one, punctuated by periods of pretended high
      respectability&mdash;while the funds to support it had lasted. And upon
      her hands had been placed Louise Lambert, the child Charles Benton had
      adopted ten years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to exercise a good deal of discretion and caution in regard
      to Louise,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;The affair is not at all so plain sailing as I
      at first believed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is a serious contretemps that you had to leave Paris, Molly,&rdquo;
       agreed her well-dressed visitor. &ldquo;The young American was a fool, of
      course, but I think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris was flooded by rich young men from the United States who came over
      to fight the Boche and to spend their money like water when on leave in
      Paris. Frank was only one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benton was silent. The affair was a distinctly unsavoury one. Frank van
      Geen, the son of the Dutch-American millionaire cocoa manufacturer of
      Chicago, had, by reason of his association with Molly, found himself the
      poorer by nearly a quarter of a million francs, and his body had been
      found in the Seine between the Pont d&rsquo;Auteuil and the Ile St. Germain. At
      the inquiry some ugly disclosures were made, but already the lady of the
      Rue Racine and her supposed niece had left Paris; and though the affair
      was one of suicide, the police raised a hue and cry, and the frontiers had
      been watched, but the pair had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was several months ago. And now Molly Maxwell the adventuress in
      Paris had been transformed into the wealthy and highly respectable widow
      Mrs. Bond, who having presented such excellent references had become
      tenant of that well-furnished mansion, Shapley Manor, and the beautiful
      grounds adjoining. For nearly two centuries it had been the home of the
      Puttenhams, but Sir George Puttenham, Baronet, the present owner, had
      found himself ruined by war-taxation, and as one of the new poor he had
      been glad to let the place and live upon the rent obtained for it. His
      case, indeed, was only one of thousands of others in England, where
      adventurers and war-profiteers were ousting the landed gentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne is evidently keeping a good watch upon young Hugh,&rdquo; remarked
      Benton presently, as he blew a ring of cigarette smoke towards the
      ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the woman, her eyes fixed out of the big window which
      commanded a glorious view of Gibbet Hill, at Hindhead, and the blue South
      Downs towards the English Channel. But all was dark and lowering in the
      winter twilight, now fast darkening into night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In old-world Guildford, the county town of Surrey, with its steep High
      Street containing many seventeenth-century houses, its old inns, and its
      balconied Guildhall&mdash;the scene of so many unseemly wrangles among the
      robed and cocked-hatted borough councillors who are, <i>par excellence</i>,
      outstanding illustrations of the provincial petty jealousies of bumbledom&mdash;Mrs.
      Bond was welcomed by the trades-people who vied with each other to &ldquo;serve
      her.&rdquo; Almost daily she went up and down the High Street in her fine
      Rolls-Royce driven by Mead, an ex-soldier and a worthy fellow whom she had
      engaged through an advertisement in the <i>Surrey Advertiser</i>. He had
      been in the Queen&rsquo;s West Surrey, and his home being in Guildford, Molly
      knew that he would serve as a testimonial to her high respectability.
      Molly Maxwell was an outstandingly clever woman. She never let a chance
      slip by that might be taken advantageously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mead, who went on his &ldquo;push-bike&rdquo; every evening along the Hog&rsquo;s Back to
      Guildford, was never tired of singing the praises of his generous
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a real good sort,&rdquo; he would tell his friends in the bar of the Lion
      or the Angel. &ldquo;She knows how to treat a man. She&rsquo;s a widow, and
      good-looking. I suppose she&rsquo;ll marry again. Nearly all the best people
      about here have called on her within the last week or two. Magistrates and
      their wives, retired generals, and lots of the gentry. Yes, my job isn&rsquo;t
      to be sneezed at, I can tell you. It&rsquo;s better than driving a lorry outside
      Ypres!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bond treated Mead extremely well, and paid him well. She knew that by
      so doing she would secure a good advertisement. She had done so before,
      when four or five years ago she had lived at Keswick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Charles,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really very apprehensive
      regarding the present situation. Yvonne is, no doubt, keeping a watchful
      eye upon the young fellow. But what can she do if he has followed the
      Ranscomb girl and is with her each day? Each day, indeed, must bring the
      pair closer together, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we must prevent, my dear Molly!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady&rsquo;s
      visitor. &ldquo;Think of all it means to us. You are quite safe here&mdash;as
      safe as I am to-day. But we can&rsquo;t last out without money&mdash;either of
      us. We must have cash-money&mdash;and cash-money always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s so. But Yvonne is wonderful&mdash;amazing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t the same stake in the affair as we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the woman for whom the European police were in search.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, because she is rich&mdash;she&rsquo;s won pots of money at the tables&mdash;and
      we&mdash;well, both of us have only limited means. Yours, Molly, are
      larger than mine&mdash;thanks to Frank. But I must have money soon. My
      expenses in town are mounting up daily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your rooms don&rsquo;t cost you very much! Old Mrs. Evans looks after
      things as she has always done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But everything is going up in price, and remember, I dare not cross
      the Channel just now. At Calais, Boulogne, Cherbourg, and other places,
      they have my photograph, and they are waiting for me to fall into the
      trap. But the rat, once encaged, is shy! And I am very shy just now,&rdquo; he
      added with a light laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay and have dinner, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; urged his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benton hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do Louise may return, and just now I don&rsquo;t want to meet her. It is
      better not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she won&rsquo;t be back till the last train to Guildford. Mead is meeting
      her. Yes&mdash;stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get a car to take me back to town. I have to go to Glasgow by the
      early train in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re order one from one of the garages in Guildford. You really
      must stay, Charles. There&rsquo;s lots we have to talk over&mdash;a lot of
      things that are of vital consequence to us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there came a rap at the door and the young manservant
      entered, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted on the telephone, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bond rose from the settee and went to the telephone in the library,
      where she heard the voice of a female telephone operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Shapley Manor?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I have a telegram for Mrs. Bond.
      Handed in at Nice at two twenty-five, received here at four twenty-eight.
      &lsquo;To Bond, Shapley Manor, near Guildford. Yvonne shot by some unknown
      person while with Hugh. In grave danger.&mdash;S.&rsquo; That is the message.
      Have you got it please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bond held her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; replied the telephone operator at the Guildford Post Office.
      &ldquo;Nothing else. I will forward the duplicate by post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she switched off.

    <h2>
      SIXTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FACING THE UNKNOWN
    </h3>
    <p>
      That the police were convinced that Hugh Henfrey had shot Mademoiselle was
      plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever he went an agent of detective police followed him. At the Cafe de
      Paris as he took his aperitif on the <i>terrasse</i> the man sat at a
      table near, idly smoking a cigarette and glancing at an illustrated paper
      on a wooden holder. In the gardens, in the Rooms, in the Galerie,
      everywhere the same insignificant little man haunted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after luncheon he met Dorise and her mother in the Rooms. With them
      were the Comte d&rsquo;Autun, an elegant young Frenchman, well known at the
      tables, and Madame Tavera, a very chic person who was one of the most
      admired visitors of that season. They were only idling and watching the
      players at the end table, where a stout, bearded Russian was making some
      sensational coups <i>en plein</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Hugh succeeded in getting Dorise alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully stuffy here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go outside&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they descended the red-carpeted steps and out into the palm-lined
      Place, at that hour thronged by the smartest crowd in Europe. Indeed, the
      war seemed to have led to increased extravagance and daring in the dress
      of those gay Parisiennes, those butterflies of fashion who were everywhere
      along the Cote d&rsquo;Azur.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned the corner by the Palais des Beaux Arts into the Boulevard
      Peirara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk out of the town,&rdquo; he suggested to the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of the
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, Hugh,&rdquo; Dorise admitted. &ldquo;For the first fortnight the unceasing
      round of gaiety and the novelty of the Rooms are most fascinating, but,
      after that, one seems cooped up in an atmosphere of vicious unreality. One
      longs for the open air and open country after this enervating, exotic
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So when they arrived at the little church of Ste. Devote, the patron saint
      of Monaco, that little building which everyone knows standing at the
      entrance to that deep gorge the Vallon des Gaumates, they descended the
      steep, narrow path which runs beside the mountain torrent and were soon
      alone in the beautiful little valley where the grey-green olives overhang
      the rippling stream. The little valley was delightfully quiet and rural
      after the garish scenes in Monte Carlo, the cosmopolitan chatter, and the
      vulgar display of the war-rich. The old habitue of pre-war days lifts his
      hands as he watches the post-war life around the Casino and listens to the
      loud uneducated chatter of the profiteer&rsquo;s womenfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the pair went along in the welcome shadows, for the sun fell strong
      upon the tumbling stream, Hugh was remarking upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been at Monte Carlo with his father before the war, and realized
      the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish mother would move on,&rdquo; Dorise exclaimed as they strolled
      slowly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      She presented a dainty figure in cream gabardine and a broad-brimmed straw
      hat which suited her admirably. Her clothes were made by a certain famous
      <i>couturiere</i> in Hanover Square, for Lady Ranscomb had the art of
      dressing her daughter as well as she did herself. Gowns make the lady
      nowadays, or the fashionable dressmakers dare not make their exorbitant
      charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you also are tired of the place?&rdquo; asked Hugh, as he strolled slowly
      at her side in a dark-blue suit and straw hat. They made a handsome pair,
      and were indeed well suited to each other. Lady Ranscomb liked Hugh, but
      she had no idea that the young people had fallen so violently in love with
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Mother promised to spend Easter in Florence. I&rsquo;ve
      never been there and am looking forward to it so much. The Marchesa
      Ruggeri, whom we met at Harrogate last summer, has a villa there, and has
      invited us for Easter. But mother said this morning that she preferred to
      remain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Somebody in the hotel has put her off. An old Englishwoman who lives
      in Florence told her that there&rsquo;s nothing to see beyond the Galleries, and
      that the place is very catty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh laughed and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All British colonies in Continental cities are catty, my dear Dorise.
      They say that for scandal Florence takes the palm. I went there for two
      seasons in succession before the war, and found the place delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marchesa is a charming woman. Her husband was an attache at the
      Italian Embassy in Paris. But he has been transferred to Washington, so
      she has gone back to Florence. I like her immensely, and I do so want to
      visit her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must persuade your mother to take you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be
      easily persuaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She doesn&rsquo;t like travelling in Italy. She once had her
      dressing-case stolen from the train between Milan and Genoa, so she&rsquo;s
      always horribly bitter against all Italians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are thieves also on English railways, Dorise,&rdquo; Hugh remarked.
      &ldquo;People are far too prone to exaggerate the shortcomings of foreigners,
      and close their eyes to the faults of the British.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But everybody is not so cosmopolitan as you are, Hugh,&rdquo; the girl laughed,
      raising her eyes to those of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you sigh?&rdquo; asked the girl, having noticed a change in her
      companion ever since they had met in the Rooms. He seemed strangely
      thoughtful and preoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly pulling himself together. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he
      added with a forced laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look yourself to-day, Hugh,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told that once before,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The weather&mdash;I think!
      Are you going over to the <i>bal blanc</i> at Nice to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. And you are coming also. Hasn&rsquo;t mother asked you?&rdquo; she
      inquired in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How silly! She must have forgotten. She told me she intended to ask you
      to have a seat in the car. The Comte d&rsquo;Autun is coming with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! He admires you, Dorise, hence I don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; Hugh blurted forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, surely, you&rsquo;re not jealous, you dear old thing!&rdquo; laughed the girl,
      tantalizing him. Perhaps she would not have uttered those words which cut
      deeply into his heart had she known the truth concerning the tragedy at
      the Villa Amette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him because he seems to live by gambling,&rdquo; Hugh declared. &ldquo;I
      know your mother likes him very much&mdash;of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she likes you, too, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may like me, but I fear she begins to suspect that we love each
      other, dearest,&rdquo; he said in a hard tone. &ldquo;If she does, she will take care
      in future to keep us apart, and I&mdash;I shall lose you, Dorise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no, you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! But I shall! Your mother will never allow you to marry a man who has
      only just sufficient to rub along with, and who is already in debt to his
      tailor. What hope is there that we can ever marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Hugh, you are awfully pessimistic to-day,&rdquo; the girl cried. &ldquo;What
      is up with you? Have you lost heavily at the tables&mdash;or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have been thinking of the future,&rdquo; he said in a hard voice so very
      unusual to him. &ldquo;I am thinking of your mother&rsquo;s choice of a husband for
      you&mdash;George Sherrard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate him&mdash;the egotistical puppy!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, her fine
      eyes flashing with anger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never marry him&mdash;<i>never</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Hugh Henfrey made no reply, and they went on together in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you trust me, Hugh?&rdquo; asked the girl at last in a low earnest tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearest. I trust you, of course. But I feel certain that your
      mother, when she knows our secret, will forbid your seeing me, and press
      on your marriage with Sherrard. Remember, he&rsquo;s a rich man, and your mother
      adores the Golden Calf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know she does. If people have money she wants to know them. Her first
      inquiry is whether they have money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on the tip of Hugh&rsquo;s tongue to remark with sarcasm that such ideals
      might well be expected of the wife of a jerry-builder in Golder&rsquo;s green.
      But he hesitated. Lady Ranscomb was always well disposed towards him, and
      he had had many good times at her house and on the grouse moor she rented
      in Scotland each year for the benefit of her intimate friends. Though she
      had been the wife of a small builder and had commenced her married life in
      an eight-roomed house on the fringe of Hampstead Heath, yet she had picked
      up society manners marvellously well, being a woman of quick intelligence
      and considerable wit. Nevertheless, she had no soul above money, and
      gaiety was as life to her. She could not live without it. Dorise had been
      given an excellent education, and after three years at Versailles was now
      voted one of the prettiest and most charming girls in London society.
      Hence mother and daughter were sought after everywhere, and their doings
      were constantly being chronicled in the newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your mother has not asked me over to Nice to-night
      because she believes you and I have been too much together of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; declared Dorise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not that, Hugh&mdash;I&rsquo;m quite sure!
      It&rsquo;s simply an oversight. I&rsquo;ll see about it when we get back. We leave the
      hotel at half-past nine. It is the great White Ball of the Nice season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mention it to her on any account, Dorise,&rdquo; Hugh urged. &ldquo;If
      you did it would at once show her that you preferred my company to that of
      the Count. Go with him. I shan&rsquo;t be jealous! Besides, in view of my
      financial circumstances, what right have I to be jealous? You can&rsquo;t marry
      a fellow like myself, Dorise. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl halted. In her eyes shone the light of unshed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh! What do you mean? What are you saying?&rdquo; she asked in a low,
      faltering voice. &ldquo;Have I not told you that whatever happens I shall never
      love another man but yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a long breath, and without replying placed his strong arms around
      her and, drawing her to him, kissed her passionately upon the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my darling,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Thank you for those words. They put
      into me a fresh hope, a fresh determination, and a fearlessness&mdash;oh!
      you&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; he added in a low, earnest voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I know, Hugh, is that you love me,&rdquo; was the simple response as she
      reciprocated his fierce caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love you, darling!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Yes. You are mine&mdash;mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, Hugh. I love no other man. I hate that tailor&rsquo;s dummy, George
      Sherrard, and as for the Count&mdash;well, he&rsquo;s an idiotic Frenchman&mdash;the
      &lsquo;hardy annual of Monte Carlo&rsquo; I heard him called the other day. No, Hugh,
      I assure you that you have no cause for jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she smiled sweetly into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing together beneath a twisted old olive tree through the
      dark foliage of which the sun shone in patches, while by their feet the
      mountain torrent from the high, snow-clad Alps rippled and splashed over
      the great grey boulders towards the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, darling! I know it,&rdquo; Hugh said in a stifled voice. He was
      thinking of the tragedy of that night, but dare not disclose to her his
      connexion with it, because he knew the police suspected him of making that
      murderous attack upon the famous &ldquo;Mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Hugh,&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, still clasped in her lover&rsquo;s arms.
      &ldquo;But somehow you don&rsquo;t seem your old self to-day. What is the matter?
      Can&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling. Excuse me. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m a bit upset that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m upset because for the last day or two I have begun to realize that
      our secret must very soon come out, and then&mdash;well, your mother will
      forbid me the house because I have no money. You know that she worships
      Mammon always&mdash;just as your father did&mdash;forgive me for my
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do forgive you because you speak the truth,&rdquo; Dorise replied. &ldquo;I know
      that mother wants me to marry a rich man, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she will compel you to do so, darling. I am convinced of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;I will never marry a man I do not love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother, if she doesn&rsquo;t suspect our compact, will soon do so,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a clever woman. She is on the alert, because she intends you
      to marry soon, and to marry a rich man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother is far too fond of society, I admit. She lives only for her gay
      friends now that father is dead. She spends lavishly upon luncheons and
      dinners at the Ritz, the Carlton, and Claridge&rsquo;s; and by doing so we get
      to know all the best people. But what does it matter to me? I hate it all
      because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she looked straight into his eyes as she broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;because&mdash;because I love you, Hugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! darling! You have never been so frank with me before,&rdquo; he said
      softly. &ldquo;You do not know how much those words of yours mean to me! You do
      not know how all my life, all my hopes, all my future, is centred in your
      own dear self!&rdquo; and clasping her again tightly in his arms he pressed his
      lips fondly to hers in a long passionate embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet within the stout heart of Hugh Henfrey, who was so straight, honest
      and upright a young fellow as ever trod the Broad at Oxford, lay that
      ghastly secret&mdash;indeed, a double secret&mdash;that of his revered
      father&rsquo;s mysterious end and the inexplicable attack upon Yvonne Ferad at
      the very moment when he had been about to learn the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lingered there beside the mountain stream for a long time, until the
      sun sank and the light began to fail. Again and again he told her of his
      great love for her, but he said nothing of the strange clause in his
      father&rsquo;s will. She knew Louise Lambert, having met her once walking in the
      park with her lover. Hugh had introduced them, and had afterwards
      explained that the girl was the adopted daughter of a great friend of his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise little dreamed that if her lover married her he would inherit the
      remainder of old Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come over to the ball at Nice to-night,&rdquo; the girl urged presently as
      they stood with hands clasped gazing into each other&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;It will be
      nothing without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! darling, that&rsquo;s very nice of you to say so, but I think we ought to
      be discreet. Your mother has invited the Count to go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate him!&rdquo; Dorise declared. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all elegance, bows and flattery. He
      bores me to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can quite understand that. But your mother is fond of his society. She
      declares that he is so amusing, and in Paris he knows everyone worth
      knowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. He gave us an awfully good time in Paris last season&mdash;took
      us to Longchamps, and we afterwards went to Deauville with him. He wins
      and loses big sums on the turf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A born gambler. Everyone knows that. I heard a lot about him in the
      Travellers&rsquo; Club, in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if mother telephones to you, you&rsquo;ll come with us&mdash;won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
       entreated the girl again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man hesitated. His mind was full of the tragic affair of the
      previous night. He was wondering whether the end had come&mdash;whether
      Mademoiselle&rsquo;s lips were already sealed by Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave an evasive reply, whereupon Dorise, taking his hand in hers, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your objection to going out with us to-night, Hugh? Do tell me.
      If you don&rsquo;t wish me to go, I&rsquo;ll make an excuse to mother and she can take
      the Count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the slightest objection,&rdquo; he declared at once. &ldquo;Go, dearest&mdash;only
      leave me out of it. The <i>bal blanc</i> is always good fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not go if you refuse to go,&rdquo; she said with a pout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore in order to please her he consented&mdash;providing Lady
      Ranscomb invited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had wandered a long way up the narrow, secluded valley, but had met
      not a soul. All was delightful and picturesque, the profusion of wild
      flowers, the huge grey moss-grown boulders, the overhanging ilexes and
      olives, and the music of the tumbling current through a crooked course
      worn deep by the waters of primeval ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was seldom that in the whirl of society the pair could get a couple of
      hours together without interruption. And under the blue Riviera sky they
      were indeed fraught with bliss to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they returned to the town the dusk was already falling, and the great
      arc lamps along the terrace in front of the Casino were already lit. Hugh
      took her as far as the entrance to the Metropole and then, after wishing
      her au revoir and promising to go with her to Nice if invited, he hastily
      retraced his steps to the Palmiers. Five minutes later he was speaking to
      the old Italian at the Villa Amette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle is still unconscious, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; was the servant&rsquo;s reply to
      his eager inquiry. &ldquo;The doctors have been several times this afternoon,
      but they hold out no hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I can be of any assistance?&rdquo; Hugh asked in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not, m&rsquo;sieur. What assistance can any of us give poor
      Mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, what indeed, Hugh thought as he put down the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet while she lived, there was still a faint hope that he would be able to
      learn the secret which he anticipated would place him in such a position
      that he might defy those who had raised their hands against his father and
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His marriage with Dorise, indeed his whole future, depended upon the
      disclosure of the clever plot whereby Louise Lambert was to become his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend Brock was not in the hotel, so he went to his room to dress for
      dinner. Ten minutes later a page brought a message from Lady Ranscomb
      inviting him to go over to Nice to the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a long breath. He was in no mood for dancing that night, for he
      was far too perturbed regarding the critical condition of the notorious
      woman who had turned his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      On every hand there were whispers and wild reports concerning the tragedy
      at the Villa Amette. He had heard about it from a dozen people, though not
      a word was in the papers. Yet nobody dreamed that he, of all men, had been
      present when the mysterious shot was fired, or that he was, indeed, the
      cause of the secret attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed slowly, and having done so, descended to the <i>salle a manger</i>.
      The big white room was filled with a gay, reckless cosmopolitan crowd&mdash;the
      crowd of well-dressed moths of both sexes which eternally flutters at
      night at Monte Carlo, attracted by the candle held by the great god
      Hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brock was not there, and he seated himself alone at their table near the
      long-curtained window. He was surprised at his friend&rsquo;s absence. Perhaps,
      however, he had met friends and gone over to Beaulieu, Nice, or Mentone
      with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had but little appetite. He ate a small portion of langouste with an
      exquisite salad, and drank a single glass of chablis. Then he rose and
      quitted the chattering, laughing crowd of diners, whose gossip was mainly
      upon a sensational run on the red at five o&rsquo;clock that evening. One woman,
      stout and of Hebrew type, sitting with three men, was wildly merry, for
      she had won the equivalent to sixty thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that recklessness jarred upon the young man&rsquo;s nerves. He tried to
      close his ears to it all, and ascended again to his room, where he sat in
      silent despondency till it was time for him to go round to the Metropole
      to join Lady Ranscomb and Dorise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had brushed his hair and rearranged his tie, and was about to put on
      the pierrot&rsquo;s costume of white satin with big buttons of black velvet
      which he had worn at the <i>bal blanc</i> at Mentone about a week before,
      when the page handed him another note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Written in a distinctly foreign hand, it read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instantly you receive this get into a travelling-suit and put what money
      and valuables you have into your pockets. Then go to a dark-green car
      which will await you by the reservoir in the Boulevard du Midi. Trust the
      driver. You must get over the frontier into Italy at the earliest moment.
      Every second&rsquo;s delay is dangerous to you. Do not trouble to find out who
      sends you this warning! <i>Bon voyage!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey read it and re-read it. The truth was plain. The police of
      Monaco suspected him, and intended that he should be arrested on suspicion
      of having committed the crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who was his unknown friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the window reflecting. If he did not keep his appointment with
      Dorise she would reproach him for breaking his word to her. On the other
      hand, if he motored to Nice he would no doubt be arrested on the French
      frontier a few miles along the Corniche road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspector Ogier suspected him, hence discretion was the better part of
      valour. So, after brief consideration, he threw off his dress clothes and
      assumed a suit of dark tweed. He put his money and a few articles of
      jewellry in his pockets, and getting into his overcoat he slipped out of
      the hotel by the back entrance used by the staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, he walked in the darkness along the Boulevard du Nord, past the
      Turbie station, until he came to the long blank wall behind which lay the
      reservoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the kerb he saw the dim red rear-light of a car, and almost at the same
      moment a rough-looking Italian chauffeur approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, signore!&rdquo; he whispered excitedly. &ldquo;Every moment is full of danger.
      There is a warrant out for your arrest! The police know that you intended
      to go to Nice and they are watching for you on the Corniche road. But we
      will try to get into Italy. You are an invalid, remember! You&rsquo;ll find in
      the car a few things with which you can make up to look the part. You are
      an American subject and a cripple, who cannot leave the car when the
      customs officers search it. Now, signore, let&rsquo;s be off and trust to our
      good fortune in getting away. I will tell the officers of the <i>dogana</i>
      at Ventimiglia a good story&mdash;trust me! I haven&rsquo;t been smuggling
      backwards and forwards for ten years without knowing the ropes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are we going?&rdquo; asked Hugh bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, signore, are going to prison if we fail on this venture, I fear,&rdquo;
       was the rough-looking driver&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      So urged by him Hugh got into the car, and then they drove swiftly along
      the sea-road of the littoral towards the rugged Italian frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey was going forth to face the unknown.

    <h2>
      SEVENTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FROM DARK TO DAWN
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the darkness the car went swiftly through Mentone and along the steep
      winding road which leads around the rugged coast close to the sea&mdash;the
      road over the yellow rocks which Napoleon made into Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they began to ascend a hill, a lonely, wind-swept highway with
      the sea plashing deep below, when, after a sudden bend, some lights came
      into view. It was the wayside Italian Customs House.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had arrived at the frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh, by the aid of a flash-lamp, had put on a grey moustache and changed
      his clothes, putting his own into the suit case wherein he had found the
      suit already prepared for him. He had wrapped himself up in a heavy
      travelling-rug, and by his side reposed a pair of crutches, so that when
      they drew up before the little roadside office of the Italian <i>dogana</i>
      he was reclining upon a cushion presenting quite a pathetic figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who had made all these preparations for his flight?
    </p>
    <p>
      He held his breath as the chauffeur sounded his horn to announce his
      arrival. Then the door opened, shedding a long ray of light across the
      white dusty road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Buona sera, signore</i>!&rdquo; cried the chauffeur merrily, as a Customs
      officer in uniform came forward. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my driving licence and papers for
      the car. And our two passports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man took them, examined them by the light of his electric torch, and
      told the chauffeur to go into the office for the visas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything to declare?&rdquo; he added in Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half a dozen very bad cigarettes,&rdquo; replied the other, laughing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      French! And also I&rsquo;ve got a very bad cold! No duty on that, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer laughed, and then turned his attention to the petrol tank,
      into which he put his measuring iron to see how much it contained, while
      the facetious chauffeur stood by.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this operation two other men came out of the building, one an
      Italian carabineer in epaulettes and cocked hat, while the other, tall and
      shrewd-faced, was in mufti. The latter was the agent of French police who
      inspects all travellers leaving France by road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur realized that the moment was a critical one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rolling a cigarette unconcernedly, but bending to the Customs
      officer, he said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My <i>padrone</i> is an <i>Americano</i>. An invalid, and a bit
      eccentric. Lots of money. A long time ago he injured his spine and can
      hardly move. He fell down a few days ago, and now I&rsquo;ve got to take him to
      Professor Landrini, in Turin. He&rsquo;s pretty bad. We&rsquo;ve come from Hyeres. His
      doctor ordered me to take him to Turin at once. We don&rsquo;t want any delay.
      He told me to give you this,&rdquo; and he slipped a note for a hundred lire
      into the man&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer expressed surprise, but the merry chauffeur of the rich
      American exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. The <i>Americano</i> is very rich; I only wish there were
      more of his sort about. He&rsquo;s the great Headon, the meat-canner of Chicago.
      You see his name on the tins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man recognized the name, and at once desisted in his examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then to the two police officers who came to his side, he explained:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The American gentleman inside is an invalid, going to Turin to Professor
      Landrini. He wants to get off at once, for he has a long journey over the
      Alps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The French agent of police grunted suspiciously. Both the French and
      Italian police are very astute, but money always talks. It is the same at
      a far-remote frontier station as in any circle of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a well-known American&mdash;the Customs officer had mentioned the
      name of Headon, which both police officers recognized&mdash;an invalid
      sent with all haste to the famous surgeon in Turin. It was not likely that
      he would be carrying contraband, or be an escaping criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, the chauffeur, in full view of the two police agents, slipped a
      second note into the hand of the Customs officer, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So all is well, isn&rsquo;t it, signori? Just visa my papers, and we&rsquo;ll get
      along. It looks as though we&rsquo;re to have a bad thunderstorm, and, if so, we
      shall catch it up on the Col di Tenda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus impelled, the quartette went back to the well-lit little building,
      where the beetle-browed driver again chaffed the police-agents, while the
      Customs officer placed his rubber stamp upon the paper, scribbled his
      initials and charged three-lire-twenty as fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was being watched with breathless anxiety by the supposed invalid
      reclining against the cushion with his crutches at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the mysterious chauffeur reappeared, and with him the French police
      officer in plain clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are keeping watch for a young Englishman from Monte Carlo who has shot
      a woman,&rdquo; remarked the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! But they arrested him to-night in Mentone,&rdquo; replied the driver. &ldquo;I
      heard it half an hour ago as I came through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they told me so at the Garage Grimaldi. He shot a woman known as
      Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo&mdash;didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the man! But they have not informed us yet. I&rsquo;ll telephone to
      Mentone.&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;As a formality I&rsquo;ll just have a peep at your
      master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur held his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty bad, I think. I hope we shall be in Turin early in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Advancing to the car, the police officer opened the door and flashed his
      torch upon the occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw a pale, elderly man, with a grey moustache, wearing a golf cape and
      reclining uneasily upon the pillow, with his leg propped up and wrapped
      with a heavy travelling-rug. Upon the white countenance was an expression
      of pain as he turned wearily, his eyes dazzled by the sudden light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; he asked faintly in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Italian <i>douane</i>, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; was the police officer&rsquo;s reply,
      as for a few seconds he gazed upon the invalid&rsquo;s face, seconds that seemed
      hours to Hugh. He was, of course, unaware of the cock-and-bull story which
      his strange chauffeur had told, and feared that at any moment he might
      find himself under arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the door remained open there was danger. At last, however, the man
      reclosed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh&rsquo;s heart gave a great bound. The chauffeur had restarted the engine,
      and mounting to the wheel shouted a merry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Buona notte, signori</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the car moved away along the winding road and Hugh knew that he was
      on Italian soil&mdash;that he had happily escaped from France.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why had he escaped, he reflected? He was innocent. Would not his
      flight lend colour to the theory that Yvonne Ferad had been shot by his
      hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, who was his unknown friend who had warned him of his peril and made
      those elaborate arrangements for his escape? Besides, where was Walter?
    </p>
    <p>
      His brain was awhirl. As they tore along in the darkness ever beside the
      sea over that steep and dangerous road along the rock coast, Hugh Henfrey
      fell to wondering what the motive of it all could be. Why had Yvonne been
      shot just at that critical moment? It was evident that she had been
      closely watched by someone to whom her silence meant a very great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had told him that his father had been a good man, and she was on the
      point of disclosing to him the great secret when she had been struck down.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the mystery of it all? Ay, what indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled every incident of that fateful night, her indignation at his
      presence in her house, and her curious softening of manner towards him, as
      though repentant and ready to make amends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he wondered what Dorise would think when he failed to put in an
      appearance to go with her to the ball at Nice. He pictured the car waiting
      outside the hotel, Lady Ranscomb fidgeting and annoyed, the count elegant
      and all smiles and graces, and Dorise, anxious and eager, going to the
      telephone and speaking to the concierge at the Palmiers. Then inquiry for
      Monsieur Henfrey, and the discovery that he had left the hotel unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far Dorise knew nothing of Hugh&rsquo;s part in the drama of the Villa
      Amette, but suddenly he was horrified by the thought that the police,
      finding he had escaped, would question her. They had been seen together
      many times in Monte Carlo, and the eyes of the police of Monaco are always
      very wide open. They know much, but are usually inactive. When one
      recollects that all the <i>escrocs</i> of Europe gather at the <i>tapis
      vert</i> in winter and spring, it is not surprising that they close their
      eyes to such minor crimes as theft, blackmail and false pretences.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his excited and unnerved state, he pictured Ogier calling upon Lady
      Ranscomb and questioning her closely concerning her young English friend
      who was so frequently seen with her daughter. That would, surely, end
      their friendship! Lady Ranscomb would never allow her daughter to
      associate further with a man accused of attempting to murder a notorious
      woman after midnight!
    </p>
    <p>
      The car presently descended the steep rocky road which wound up over the
      promontory and back again down to the sea, until they passed through the
      little frontier town of Ventimiglia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late, and few people were about in the narrow, ill-lit streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a couple of Italian carabineers stopped the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh&rsquo;s heart beat quickly. Had they at the <i>dogana</i> discovered the
      trick and telephoned from the frontier?
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the fugitive reassumed his role of invalid, and no sooner had he
      settled himself than the second man in a cocked hat and heavy black cloak
      opened the door and peered within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another lamp was flashed upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carabineer asked in Italian:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name, signore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Hugh, pretending that he did not understand the language, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are our papers, signore,&rdquo; interrupted the ever-ready chauffeur, and
      he produced the papers for the officer&rsquo;s inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at them, bending to read them by the light of the torch which
      his companion held.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after an officious gesture, he handed them back, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Benissimo</i>! You may pass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Hugh was free! Yet he wondered if that examination had been
      consequent upon the hue and cry set up now that he had escaped from
      Monaco.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed out of the straggling town of Ventimiglia, but instead of
      turning up the valley by that long road which winds up over the Alps until
      it reaches the snow and then passes through the tunnel on the Col di Tenda
      and on to Cuneo and Turin, the mysterious driver kept on by the sea-road
      towards Bordighera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh realised that his guide&rsquo;s intention was to go in the direction of
      Genoa.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two miles out of Ospedaletti, on the road to San Remo, Henfrey
      rapped at the window, and the chauffeur, who was travelling at high speed,
      pulled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh got out and said in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so far we&rsquo;ve been successful. I admire your ingenuity and your
      pluck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed and thanked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done what I was told to do,&rdquo; he replied simply. &ldquo;Monsieur is, I
      understand, in a bit of a scrape, and it is for all of us to assist each
      other&mdash;is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But who told you to do all this?&rdquo; Hugh inquired, standing in
      the dark road beside the car. The pair could not see each other&rsquo;s faces,
      though the big head-lamps glared far ahead over the white road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;a friend of yours, m&rsquo;sieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, I am not allowed to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this is so very strange&mdash;so utterly mysterious!&rdquo; cried Hugh.
      &ldquo;I have not committed any crime, and yet I am hunted by the police! They
      are anxious to arrest me for an offence of which I am entirely innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; was the fellow&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;At the <i>dogana</i>,
      however, we had a narrow escape. The man who looked at you was Morain, the
      chief inspector of the Surete of the Alpes-Maritimes, and he was at the
      outpost especially to stop you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again I admire your perfect nonchalance and ingenuity,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;I owe
      my liberty entirely to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not liberty, m&rsquo;sieur. We are not yet what you say in English &lsquo;out of the
      wood.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Genoa. We ought to be there by early morning,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Morain
      has, no doubt, telephoned to Mentone and discovered that my story is
      false. So if later, on, they suspect the American invalid they will be
      looking out for him on the Col di Tenda, in Cuneo, and in Turin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall we do in Genoa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get there first&mdash;and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wish you would tell me who you are&mdash;and why you take such a
      keen interest in my welfare,&rdquo; Hugh said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man gave vent to an irritating laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not permitted to disclose the identity of your friend,&rdquo; he answered.
      &ldquo;All I know is that you are innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps you know the guilty person?&rdquo; Hugh suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Let us talk of something else, signore,&rdquo; was the mysterious
      chauffeur&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I confess to you that I am bent upon solving the mystery of
      Mademoiselle&rsquo;s assailant. It means a very great deal to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If the culprit is found, then there would no longer
      be any suspicion against myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably he never will be found,&rdquo; the man said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, how did you know about the affair, and why are you risking
      arrest by driving me to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reasons,&rdquo; was all he would say. &ldquo;I obey the demands of those who
      are your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They desire to conceal their identity. There is a strong reason why this
      should be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they not protecting one who is suspected of a serious crime? If
      discovered they would be punished,&rdquo; was the quiet response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! There is some hidden motive behind all this!&rdquo; declared the young
      Englishman. &ldquo;I rather regret that I did not remain and face the music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been far too dangerous, signore. Your enemies would have
      contrived to convict you of the crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My enemies&mdash;but who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that, signore, I am ignorant. Only I have been told that you have
      enemies, and very bitter ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have committed no crime, and yet I am a fugitive from justice!&rdquo;
       Hugh cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You escaped in the very nick of time,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;But had we not
      better be moving again? We must be in Genoa by daybreak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do, I beg of you, tell me more,&rdquo; the young man implored. &ldquo;To whom do
      I owe my liberty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I have already told you, signore, you owe it to those who intend to
      protect you from a false charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But there is a lady in the case,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;I fear that if she
      hears that I am a fugitive she will misjudge me and believe me to be
      guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably so. That is, I admit, unfortunate&mdash;but, alas! it cannot be
      avoided. It was, however, better for you to get out of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the French police, when they know that I have escaped, will probably
      ask the Italian police to arrest me, and then apply for my extradition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they did, I doubt whether you would be surrendered. The police of my
      country are not too fond of assisting those of other countries. Thus if an
      Italian commits murder in a foreign country and gets back to Italy, our
      Government will refuse to give him up. There have been many such cases,
      and the murderer goes scot free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think I am safe in Italy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not by any means. You are not an Italian subject. No, you must
      not be very long in Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do when we get to Genoa?&rdquo; Hugh asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The signore had better wait until we arrive there,&rdquo; was the driver&rsquo;s
      enigmatical reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the supposed invalid re-entered the car and they continued on their
      way along the bleak, storm-swept road beside the sea towards that
      favourite resort of the English, San Remo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night had grown pitch dark, and rain had commenced to fall. Before the
      car the great head-lamps threw long beams of white light against which
      Hugh saw the silhouette of the muffled-up mysterious driver, with his keen
      eyes fixed straight before him, and driving at such a pace that it was
      apparent that he knew every inch of the dangerous road.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could it all mean? What, indeed?

      EIGHTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE WHITE CAVALIER
    </h3>
    <p>
      While Hugh Henfrey was travelling along that winding road over high
      headlands and down steep gradients to the sea which stretched the whole
      length of the Italian Riviera, Dorise Ranscomb in a white silk domino and
      black velvet mask was pretending to enjoy herself amid the mad gaiety at
      the Casino in Nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great <i>bal blanc</i> is always one of the most important events of
      the Nice season, and everyone of note wintering on the Riviera was there,
      yet all carefully masked, both men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what prevented Hugh from coming with us, mother?&rdquo; the girl
      remarked as she sat with Lady Ranscomb watching the merriment and the
      throwing of serpentines and confetti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He certainly ought to have let me know, and not have kept
      me waiting nearly half an hour, as he did,&rdquo; her mother snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not reply. The truth was that while her mother and the Count
      had been waiting for Hugh&rsquo;s appearance, she had gone to the telephone and
      inquired for Mr. Henfrey. Walter Brock had spoken to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Miss Ranscomb,&rdquo; he had replied. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know
      where Hugh can be. I&rsquo;ve just been up to his room, but his fancy dress is
      there, flung down as though he had suddenly discarded it and gone out.
      Nobody noticed him leave. The page at the door is certain that he did not
      go out. So he must have left by the staff entrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very curious, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Dorise remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very. I can&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he promised to go with us to the ball at Nice to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Ranscomb, all I can think is that something&mdash;something
      very important must have detained him somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walter knew that his friend was suspected by the police, but dared not
      tell her the truth. Hugh&rsquo;s disappearance had caused him considerable
      anxiety because, for aught he knew, he might already be arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Dorise, much perplexed, but resolving not to say to her mother that she
      had telephoned to the Palmiers, rejoined the Count in the hotel lounge,
      where they waited a further ten minutes. Then they entered the car and
      drove along to Nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few merrier gatherings in all Europe than the <i>bal blanc</i>.
      The Municipal Casino, at all times the center of revelry, of mild
      gambling, smart dresses and gay suppers, is on that night an amazing
      spectacle of black and white. The carnival colours&mdash;the two shades of
      colour chosen yearly by the International Fetes Committee&mdash;are
      abandoned, and only white is worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the trio entered the fun was already in full swing. The gay crowd
      disguised by their masks and fancy costumes were revelling as happily as
      school children. A party of girls dressed as clowns were playing
      leap-frog. Another party were dancing in a great and ever-widening ring.
      Girls armed with jesters&rsquo; bladders were being carried high on the
      shoulders of their male acquaintances, and striking all and sundry as they
      passed, staid, elderly folk were performing grotesque antics for persons
      of their age. The very air of the Riviera seems to be exhilarating to both
      old and young, and the constant church-goers at home quickly become
      infected by the spirit of gaiety, and conduct themselves on the
      Continental Sabbath in a manner which would horribly disgust their
      particular vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh must have been detained by something very unexpected, mother,&rdquo;
       Dorise said. &ldquo;He never disappoints us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, he does. One night we were going to the Embassy Club&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you recollect it&mdash;and he never turned up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, mother. It was really excusable. His cousin arrived from New
      York quite unexpectedly upon some family business. He phoned to you and
      explained,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what about that night when I asked him to dinner at the Ritz to
      meet the Courtenays and he rang up to say he was not well? Yet I saw him
      hale and hearty next day at a matinee at the Comedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have been indisposed, mother,&rdquo; Dorise said. &ldquo;Really I think you
      judge him just a little too harshly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I take people as I find them. Your father always said that, and
      he was no fool, my dear. He made a fortune by his cleverness, and we now
      enjoy it. Never associate with unsuccessful persons. It&rsquo;s fatal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what old Sir Dudley Ash, the steel millionaire, told me the
      other day when we were over at Cannes, mother. Never associate with the
      unlucky. Bad luck, he says, is a contagious malady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I believe it&mdash;I firmly believe it,&rdquo; declared Lady Ranscomb.
      &ldquo;Your poor father pointed it out to me long ago, and I find that what he
      said is too true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t all be lucky, mother,&rdquo; said the girl, watching the revelry
      before her blankly as she reflected upon the mystery of Hugh&rsquo;s absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But we can, nevertheless, be rich, if we look always to the main
      chance and make the best of our opportunities,&rdquo; her mother said meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the Count d&rsquo;Autun approached them. He was dressed as a
      pierrot, but being masked was only recognizable by the fine ruby ring upon
      his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will mademoiselle do me the honour?&rdquo; he said in French, bowing elegantly.
      &ldquo;They are dancing in the theatre. Will you come, Mademoiselle Dorise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; she said, with an inward sigh, for the dressed-up Parisian
      always bored her. She rose quickly, and promising her mother to be back
      soon, she linked her arm to that of the notorious gambler and passed
      through the great palm-court into the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, a few moments later, she found herself carried around amid the mad
      crowd of revellers, who laughed merrily as the coloured serpentines thrown
      from the boxes fell upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To lift one&rsquo;s <i>loup</i> was a breach of etiquette. Everyone was closely
      masked. British members of Parliament, French senators, Italian members of
      the Camera, Spanish grandees and Russian princes, all with their
      womenfolk, hob-nobbed with cocottes, <i>escrocs</i>, and the most
      notorious adventurers and adventuresses in all Europe. Truly, it was a
      never-to-be-forgotten scene of cosmopolitan fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count, who was a bad dancer, collided with a slim, well-dressed French
      girl, but did not apologize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! la la!&rdquo; cried the girl to her partner, a stout figure in
      Mephistophelian garb. &ldquo;An exquisitely polite gentleman that, mon cher
      Alphonse! I believe he must really be the Pork King from Chicago&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count heard it, and was furious. Dorise, however, said nothing. She
      was thinking of Hugh&rsquo;s strange disappearance, and how he had broken his
      word to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Lady Ranscomb, secretly very glad that Hugh had been prevented
      from accompanying them, and centring all her hopes upon her daughter&rsquo;s
      marriage with George Sherrard, sat chattering with a Mrs. Down, the fat
      wife of a war-profiteer, whose acquaintance she had made in Paris six
      months before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise made pretense of enjoying the dance though eager to get back again
      to Monte Carlo in order to learn the reason of her lover&rsquo;s absence. She
      was devoted to Hugh. He was all in all to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She danced with several partners, having first made a rendezvous with her
      mother at midnight at a certain spot under one of the great palms in the
      promenade. At masked balls the chaperon is useless, and everyone, being
      masked, looks so much alike that mistakes are easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-past one o&rsquo;clock a big motor-car drew up in the Place before
      the Casino, and a tall man in a white fancy dress of a cavalier, with
      wide-brimmed hat and staggering plume, stepped from it and, presenting his
      ticket, passed at once into the crowded ball-room. For a full ten minutes
      he stood watching the crowd of revellers intently, eyeing each of them
      keenly, though the expression on his countenance was hidden by the strip
      of black velvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes, shining through the slits in the mask, were, however, dark and
      brilliant. In them could be seen alertness and eagerness, for it was
      apparent that he had come there hot-foot in search of someone. In any case
      he had a difficult task, for in the whirling, laughing, chattering crowd
      each person resembled the other save for their feet and their stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the feet of the dancers that the tall masked man was watching. He
      stood in the crowd near the doorway with his hand upon his sword-hilt, a
      striking figure remarked by many. His large eyes were fixed upon the shoes
      of the dancers, until, of a sudden, he seemed to discover that for which
      he was in search, and made his way quickly after a pair who, having
      finished a dance, were walking in the direction of the great hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger never took his eyes off the pair. The man was slightly taller
      than the woman, and the latter wore upon her white kid shoes a pair of old
      paste buckles. It was for those buckles that he had been searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he muttered in English beneath his breath. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s she&mdash;without
      a doubt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew back to near where the pair had halted and were laughing together.
      The girl with the glittering buckles upon her shoes was Dorise Ranscomb.
      The man with her was the Count d&rsquo;Autun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white cavalier pretended to take no interest in them, but was,
      nevertheless, watching intently. At last he saw the girl&rsquo;s partner bow,
      and leaving her, he crossed to greet a stout Frenchwoman in a plain
      domino. In a moment the cavalier was at the girl&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do not betray surprise, Miss Ranscomb,&rdquo; he said in a low, refined
      voice. &ldquo;We may be watched. But I have a message for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me?&rdquo; she asked, peering through her mask at the man in the plumed
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But I cannot speak to you here. It is too public. Besides, your
      mother yonder may notice us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the girl, naturally curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not let us talk here. See, right over yonder in the corner behind
      where they are dancing in a ring&mdash;under the balcony. Let us meet
      there at once. <i>Au revoir</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three minutes later they met again out of sight of Lady Ranscomb, who was
      still sitting at one of the little wicker tables talking to three other
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, who are you?&rdquo; Dorise inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white cavalier laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mr. X,&rdquo; was his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. X? Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself. But my name matters nothing, Miss Ranscomb,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
      come here to give you a confidential message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why confidential&mdash;and from whom?&rdquo; she asked, standing against the
      wall and surveying the mysterious masker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a gentleman friend of yours&mdash;Mr. Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Hugh?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected him to come with us to-night, but he has vanished from his
      hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. That is why I am here,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a note in the stranger&rsquo;s voice which struck her as somehow
      familiar, but she failed to recognize the individual. She was as quick at
      remembering voices as she was at recollecting faces. Who could he be, she
      wondered?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you had a message for me,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I am here to tell you that a serious contretemps has
      occurred, and that Mr. Henfrey has escaped from France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escaped!&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the police suspect him of a crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crime! What crime? Surely he is innocent?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly is. His friends know that. Therefore, Miss Ranscomb, I beg
      of you to betray no undue anxiety even if you do not hear from him for
      many weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will he write to me?&rdquo; she asked in despair. &ldquo;Surely he will not keep
      me in suspense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not if he can avoid it. But as soon as the French police realize
      that he has got away a watch will be kept upon his correspondence.&rdquo; Then,
      lowering his voice, he urged her to move away, as he thought that an
      idling masker was trying to overhear their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on a few moments later, &ldquo;it might be dangerous if he
      were to write to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorise was thinking of what her mother would say when the truth reached
      her ears. Hugh was a <i>fugitive</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what crime is he suspected?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t exactly know,&rdquo; was the stranger&rsquo;s faltering
      response. &ldquo;I was told by a friend of his that it was a serious one, and
      that he might find it extremely difficult to prove himself innocent. The
      circumstantial evidence against him is very strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where he is now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. All I know is that he is safely across the frontier
      into Italy,&rdquo; was the reply of the tall white cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could see your face,&rdquo; declared Dorise frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I might express a similar desire, Miss Ranscomb. But for the present
      it is best as it is. I have sought you here to tell you the truth in
      secret, and to urge you to remain calm and patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a message from Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not exactly. It is a message from one who is his friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very mysterious,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;If you do not know where he is
      at the moment, perhaps you know where we can find him later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He is making his way to Brussels. A letter addressed to Mr. Godfrey
      Brown, Poste Restante, Brussels, will eventually find him. Recollect the
      name,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Disguise your handwriting on the envelope, and when you
      post it see that you are not observed. Recollect that his safety lies in
      your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But do let me know your name,&rdquo; she implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any old name is good enough for me,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Call me Mr. X.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mystify me further, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, call me Smith, Jones, Robinson&mdash;whatever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you refuse to satisfy my curiosity&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret that I am compelled to do so&mdash;for certain reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a detective?&rdquo; Dorise suddenly inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were a police officer I should scarcely act as an intermediary
      between Mr. Henfrey and yourself, Miss Ranscomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you say he is innocent. Are you certain of that? May I set my mind at
      rest that he never committed this crime of which the police suspect him?&rdquo;
       she asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I repeat that he is entirely innocent,&rdquo; was the earnest response.
      &ldquo;But I would advise you to affect ignorance. The police may question you.
      If they do, you know nothing, remember&mdash;absolutely nothing. If you
      write to Mr. Henfrey, take every precaution that nobody sees you post the
      letter. Give him a secret address in London, or anywhere in England, so
      that he can write to you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how long will it be before I can see him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That I cannot tell. There is a mystery underlying it all that even I
      cannot fathom, Miss Ranscomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of mystery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The white cavalier shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must ask Mr. Henfrey. Or perhaps his friend Brock knows. Yet if he
      does, I do not suppose he would disclose anything his friend may have told
      him in confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am bewildered!&rdquo; the girl declared. &ldquo;It is all so very mysterious&mdash;Hugh
      a fugitive from justice! I&mdash;I really cannot believe it! What can the
      mystery be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that I have no means of ascertaining, Miss Ranscomb. I am here merely
      to tell you what has happened and to give you in secret the name and
      address to which to send a letter to him,&rdquo; the masked man said very
      politely. &ldquo;And now I think we must part. Perhaps if ever we meet again&mdash;which
      is scarcely probable&mdash;you will recognize my voice. And always
      recollect that should you or Mr. Henfrey ever receive a message from
      &lsquo;Silverado&rsquo; it will be from myself.&rdquo; And he spelt the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silverado. Yes, I shall not forget you, my mysterious friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au revoir</i>!&rdquo; he said as, bowing gracefully, he turned and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was rising from the sea when Dorise entered her bedroom at the
      hotel. Her maid had retired, so she undressed herself, and putting on a
      dressing-gown, she pulled up the blinds and sat down to write a letter to
      Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not sleep before she had sent him a reassuring message.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the frenzy of her despair she wrote one letter and addressed it, but
      having done so she changed her mind. It was not sufficiently reassuring,
      she decided. It contained an element of doubt. Therefore she tore it up
      and wrote a second one which she locked safely in her jewel case, and then
      pulled the blinds and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly noon next day before she left her room, yet almost as soon
      as she had descended in the lift the head <i>femme de chambre</i>, a stout
      Frenchwoman in a frilled cap, entered the room, and walking straight to
      the waste-paper basket gathered up the contents into her apron and went
      back along the corridor with an expression of satisfaction upon her full
      round face.

    <h2>
      NINTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CONCERNS THE SPARROW
    </h3>
    <p>
      With the rosy dawn rising behind them the big dusty car tore along over
      the white road which led through Pegli and Cornigliano, with their wealth
      of olives and palms, into the industrial suburbs of old-world Genoa. Then,
      passing around by the port, the driver turned the car up past Palazzo
      Doria and along that street of fifteenth-century palaces, the Via
      Garibaldi, into the little piazza in front of the Annunziata Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he pulled up after a run of two hours from the last of the many
      railway crossings, most of which they had found closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hugh got out, the mysterious man, whose face was more forbidding in
      the light of day, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I must leave you very shortly, signore. But first I have certain
      instructions to give you, namely, that you remain for the present in a
      house in the Via della Maddalena to which I shall take you. The man and
      the woman there you can trust. It will be as well not to walk about in the
      daytime. Remain here for a fortnight, and then by the best means, without,
      of course, re-entering France, you must get to Brussels. There you will
      receive letters at the Poste Restante in the name of Godfrey Brown. That,
      indeed, is the name you will use here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all this is very strange!&rdquo; remarked Hugh, utterly bewildered as he
      glanced at the forbidding-looking chauffeur and the dust-covered car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree, signore,&rdquo; the man laughed. &ldquo;But get in again and I will drive to
      the Via della Maddalena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later the car pulled up at the end of a narrow stuffy ancient
      street of high houses with closed wooden shutters. From house to house
      across the road household linen was flying in the wind, for the
      neighbourhood was certainly a poverty-stricken one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place did not appeal to Hugh in the least. He, however, recollected
      that he was about to hide from the police. Italians are early risers, and
      though it was only just after dawn, Genoa was already agog with life and
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the car, the mysterious chauffeur conduced the young Englishman
      along the street, where women were calling to each other from the windows
      of their apartments and exchanging salutations, until they came to an
      entrance over which there was an old blue majolica Madonna. The house had
      no outer door, but at the end of the passage was a flight of stone steps
      leading up to the five storeys above.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the third flight Hugh&rsquo;s conductor paused, and finding a piece of cord
      protruding from a hole in a door, pulled it. A slight tinkle was heard
      within, and a few moments later the sound of wooden shoes was heard upon
      the tiles inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, revealing an ugly old woman whose face was sallow and
      wrinkled, and who wore a red kerchief tied over her white hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she saw the chauffeur she welcomed him, addressing him as
      Paolo, and invited them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the English signore,&rdquo; explained the man. &ldquo;He has come to stay
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The signore is welcome,&rdquo; replied the old woman as she clattered into the
      narrow, cheaply furnished little sitting-room, which was in half darkness
      owing to the <i>persiennes</i> being closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, it was an uninviting place, which smelt of garlic and of the
      paraffin oil with which the tiled floors had been rubbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will require another certificate of identity, signore,&rdquo; said the man,
      who admitted that he had been engaged in smuggling contraband across the
      Alps. And delving into his pocket he produced an American passport. It was
      blank, though the embossed stamp of the United States Government was upon
      it. The places were ready for the photograph and signature. With it the
      man handed him a large metal disc, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have your picture taken and affixed to it, all you have to do is
      to damp the paper slightly and impress this stamp. It will then defy
      detection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where on earth did you get this from?&rdquo; asked Hugh, noticing that it was a
      replica of the United States consular seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled, replying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They make passports of all countries in Spain. You pay for them, and you
      can get them by the dozen. The embossing stamps are extra. There is a big
      trade in them now owing to the passport restrictions. Besides, in every
      country there are passport officers who are amenable to a little
      baksheesh!&rdquo; And he grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he said was true. At no period has it ever been more easy for a
      criminal to escape than it is to-day, providing, of course, that he is a
      cosmopolitan and has money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh took the passport and the disc, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to repay you for all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want no payment, signore. All I ask you is to conform to the
      suggestions of the worthy Signore Ravecca and his good wife here. You are
      not the first guest they have had for whom the police searched in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed the old woman. &ldquo;Do you recollect the syndic of Porticello,
      how we had him here for nearly three years, and then he got safely away to
      Argentina and took the money, three million lire, with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;I recollect it, signora. But the Signore
      Inglese must be very careful&mdash;very careful. He must never go out in
      the daytime. You can buy him English papers and books of Luccoli, in the
      Via Bosco. They will serve to while away the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall, no doubt, pass the time very pleasantly,&rdquo; laughed Hugh, speaking
      in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the old crone left them and returned with two cups of excellent <i>cafe
      nero</i>, that coffee which, roasted at home one can get only in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed refreshing after that long night drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh stood there without luggage, and with only about thirty pounds in his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the man who had driven him looked him curiously in the face, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I know you are wondering what your lady friend in Monte Carlo will
      think. Well, I can tell you this. She already knows that you have escaped,
      and she had been told to write to you in secret at the Poste Restante at
      Brussels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has told her? Surely she knows nothing of the affair at the Villa
      Amette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not be told that. But she has been told that you are going to
      Brussels, and that in future your name is Monsieur Godfrey Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why have all these elaborate arrangements been made for my security?&rdquo;
       Hugh demanded, more than ever nonplussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless to take one precaution unless the whole are taken,&rdquo; laughed
      the sphinx-like fellow whose cheerful banter had so successfully passed
      them through the customs barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, swallowing his coffee, he wished Hugh, &ldquo;buon viaggio&rdquo; and was about
      to depart, when Hugh said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here. Is it quite impossible for you to give me any inkling
      concerning this astounding affair? I know that some unknown friend, or
      friends, are looking after my welfare. But why? To whom am I indebted for
      all this? Who has warned Miss Ranscomb and told her of my alias and my
      journey to Brussels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of hers and of yourself,&rdquo; was the chauffeur&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;No, please
      do not question me, signore,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I have done my best for you. And
      now my journey is at an end, while yours is only beginning. Pardon me&mdash;but
      you have money with you, I suppose? If you have not, these good people
      here will trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really it is a bolt-hole used by those who wish to evade our very
      astute police. If one conforms to the rules of Signora Ravecca and her
      husband, then one is quite safe and most comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh realized that he was in a hiding-place used by thieves. A little
      later he knew that the ugly old woman&rsquo;s husband paid toll to a certain <i>delegato</i>
      of police, hence their house was never searched. While the criminal was in
      those shabby rooms he was immune from arrest. The place was, indeed, one
      of many hundreds scattered over Europe, asylums known to the international
      thief as places ever open so long as they can pay for their board and
      lodging and their contribution towards the police bribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later the ugly, uncouth man who had brought him from Monte
      Carlo lit a cigarette, and wishing the old woman a merry &ldquo;addio&rdquo; left and
      descended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signora then showed Hugh to his room, a small, dispiriting and not
      overclean little chamber which looked out upon the backs of the adjoining
      houses, all of which were high and inartistic. Above, however, was a
      narrow strip of brilliantly blue sunlit sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later he made the acquaintance of the woman&rsquo;s
      husband, a brown-faced, sinister-looking individual whose black bushy
      eyebrows met, and who greeted the young Englishman familiarly in atrocious
      French, offering him a glass of red wine from a big rush-covered flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We only had word of your coming late last night,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;You had
      already started from Monte Carlo, and we wondered if you would get past
      the frontier all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Hugh, sipping the wine out of courtesy. &ldquo;We got out of
      France quite safely. But tell me, who made all these arrangements for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Il Passero, of course,&rdquo; replied the man, whose wife addressed him
      affectionately as Beppo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Il Passero, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know him surely. Il Passero, or The Sparrow. We call him so
      because he is always flitting about Europe, and always elusive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police want him, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should rather think they do. They have been searching for him for these
      past five years, but he always dodges them, first in France, then here,
      then in Spain, and then in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is this mysterious and unknown friend of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Il Passero is the chief of the most daring of all the gangs of
      international thieves. We all work at his direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did he know of my danger?&rdquo; asked Hugh, mystified and dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Il Passero knows many strange things,&rdquo; he replied with a grin. &ldquo;It is his
      business to know them. And besides, he has some friends in the police&mdash;persons
      who never suspect him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nationality is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man Beppo shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not Italian,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Yet he speaks the <i>lingua Toscano</i>
      perfectly and French and English and <i>Tedesco</i>. He might be Belgian
      or German, or even English. Nobody knows his true nationality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the man who brought me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that was Paolo, Il Passero&rsquo;s chauffeur&mdash;a merry fellow&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remarkable,&rdquo; laughed Hugh. &ldquo;But I cannot see why The Sparrow has taken
      such a paternal interest in me,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He no doubt has, for he has, apparently, arranged for your safe return to
      England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him, of course. What manner of man is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A signore&mdash;a great signore,&rdquo; replied Beppo. &ldquo;He is rich, and is
      often on the Riviera in winter. He&rsquo;s probably there now. Nobody suspects
      him. He is often in England, too. I believe he has a house in London.
      During the war he worked for the French Secret Service under the name of
      Monsieur Franqueville, and the French Government never suspected that they
      actually had in their employ the famous Passero for whom the Surete were
      looking everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no idea where he lives in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was once told that he had a big house somewhere in what you call the
      West End&mdash;somewhere near Piccadilly. I have, however, only seen him
      once. About eighteen months ago he was hard pressed by the police and took
      refuge here for two nights, till Paolo called for him in his fine car and
      he passed out of Italy as a Swiss hotel-proprietor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is head of a gang&mdash;is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;He is marvellous, and has indeed well earned
      his sobriquet &lsquo;Il Passero.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden thought flitted through Hugh&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he is a friend of Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, signore, I do not know. Il Passero had many friends. He is rich,
      prosperous, well-dressed, and has influential friends in France, in Italy
      and in England who never suspect him to be the notorious king of the
      thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, tell me,&rdquo; urged young Henfrey. &ldquo;What do you know concerning
      Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Italian looked at him strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied, still speaking bad French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not speaking the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I tell it to you? I do not know you!&rdquo; was the quick retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are harbouring me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the orders of Il Passero.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely can tell me what you know of Mademoiselle,&rdquo; Hugh persisted
      after a brief pause. &ldquo;We are mutually her friends. The attempt to kill her
      is outrageous, and I, for one, intend to do all I can to trace and punish
      the culprit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that you shot her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;you know that I did not,&rdquo; Henfrey said. &ldquo;Have you yourself
      ever met Mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen her. She was living for a time at Santa Margherita last year.
      I had a friend of hers living here with me and I went to her with a
      message. She is a very charming lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a friend of Il Passero?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Italian shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey had certainly learned much that was curious. He had never
      before heard of the interesting cosmopolitan thief known as The Sparrow,
      but it seemed evident that the person in question had suddenly become
      interested in him for some obscure and quite unaccountable reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      As day followed day in that humble place of concealment, Beppo told him
      many things concerning the famous criminal Il Passero, describing his
      exploits in terms of admiration. Hugh learnt that it was The Sparrow who
      had planned the great jewel robbery at Binet&rsquo;s, in the Rue de la Paix,
      when some famous diamonds belonging to the Shah of Persia, which had been
      sent to Paris to be reset, were stolen. It was The Sparrow, too, who had
      planned the burglary at the art gallery of Evans and Davies in Bond Street
      and stolen Raphael&rsquo;s famous Madonna.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the daytime Hugh, anxious to get away to Brussels, but compelled to
      obey the order of the mysterious Passero, spent the time in smoking and
      reading books and newspapers with which Beppo&rsquo;s wife provided him, while
      at night he would take long walks through the silent city, with its gloomy
      old palaces, the courtyards of which echoed to his footsteps. At such
      times he was alone with his thoughts and would walk around the port and
      out upon the hills which surrounded the bay, and then sit down and gaze
      out to the twinkling lights across the sea and watch the long beams of the
      great lighthouse searching in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His host and hostess were undoubtedly criminals. Indeed, they did not hide
      the fact. Both were paid by The Sparrow to conceal and provide for anyone
      whom he sent there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been there four weary, anxious days when one evening a pretty,
      well-dressed young French girl called, and after a short chat with Beppo&rsquo;s
      wife became installed there as his fellow-guest. He did not know her name
      and she did not tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was known to them as Lisette, and Hugh found her a most vivacious and
      interesting companion. Truly, he had been thrown into very queer company,
      and he often wondered what his friends would say if they knew that he was
      guest in a hiding-place of thieves.

    <h2>
      TENTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A LESSON IN ARGOT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Late one evening the dainty girl thief, Lisette, went out for a stroll
      with Hugh, but in the Via Roma they met an agent of police.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; whispered the girl in French, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a <i>pince sans rire</i>!
      Be careful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She constantly used the argot of French thieves, which was often difficult
      for the young Englishman to understand. And the dark-haired girl would
      laugh, apologize, and explain the meaning of her strange expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the city they were soon upon the high road which wound up the deep
      green valley of the Bisagno away into the mountains, ever ascending to the
      little hill-town of Molassana. The scene was delightful in the moonlight
      as they climbed the steep hill and then descended again into the valley,
      Lisette all the time gossiping on in a manner which interested and amused
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arrival had put an end to his boredom, and, though he was longing to
      get away from his surroundings, she certainly cheered him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had walked for nearly an hour, when, declaring she felt tired, they
      sat upon a rock to rest and eat the sandwiches with which they had
      provided themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two carabineers in cloaks and cocked hats who met them on the road put
      them down as lovers keeping a clandestine tryst. They never dreamed that
      for both of them the police were in search.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me something concerning yourself, mademoiselle,&rdquo; Hugh urged
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself! Oh! la la!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;What is there to tell? I am just of <i>la
      haute pegre&mdash;a truqueuse</i>. Ah! you will not know the expression.
      Well&mdash;I am a thief in high society. I give indications where we can
      make a coup, and afterwards <i>bruler le pegriot</i>&mdash;efface the
      trace of the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Malheureusement</i>! I was in Orleans and a <i>friquet</i> nearly
      captured me. So Il Passero sent me here for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You help Il Passero&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Very often. Ah! m&rsquo;sieur, he is a most wonderful man&mdash;English, I
      think. <i>Girofle</i> (genteel and amiable), like yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, mademoiselle,&rdquo; Hugh protested, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I mean it. Il Passero is a real gentleman&mdash;but&mdash;<i>maquiller
      son truc</i>, and he is marvellous. When he exercises his wonderful talent
      and forms a plan it is always flawless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone seems to hold him in high esteem. I have never met him,&rdquo; Hugh
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in Genoa on the day that I arrived. Curious that he did not call
      and see Beppo. I lunched with him at the Concordia, and he paid me five
      thousand francs, which he owed me. He has gone to London now with his <i>ecrache-tarte</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His false passport. He has always a good supply of them for anyone in
      need of one. They are printed secretly in Spain. But m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; she added,
      &ldquo;you are not of our world. You are in just a little temporary trouble.
      Over what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In reply he was perfectly frank with her. He told her of the suspicion
      against him because of the affair of the Villa Amette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she replied, her manner changing, &ldquo;I have heard that Mademoiselle
      was shot, but I had no idea that you had any connexion with that ugly
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Unfortunately I have. Do you happen to know Yvonne Ferad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Everyone knows her. She is very charming. Nobody knows the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What truth?&rdquo; inquired Hugh quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;that she is a <i>marque de ce</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A <i>marque de ce</i>&mdash;what is that?&rdquo; asked Hugh eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! <i>non</i>, m&rsquo;sieur. I must not tell you anything against her. You
      are her friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am endeavouring to find out something about her. To me she is a
      mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. She is to everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you mean by that expression?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Do tell me. I am
      very anxious to know your opinion of her, and something about her. I have
      a very earnest motive in trying to discover who and what she really is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I told you I should offend Il Passero,&rdquo; replied the girl simply. &ldquo;It
      is evident that he wishes you should remain in ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely, you can tell me in confidence? I will divulge nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the girl, whose face he could not see in the shadow. &ldquo;I am
      sorry, M&rsquo;sieur Brown&rdquo;&mdash;she had not been told his Christian name&mdash;&ldquo;but
      I am not permitted to tell you anything concerning Mademoiselle Yvonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a very remarkable person&mdash;eh?&rdquo; said Henfrey, again defeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remarkable! Oh, yes. She is of the <i>grande monde</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that still your argot?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no. Mademoiselle Yvonne is a lady. Some say she is the daughter of a
      rich Englishman. Others say she is just a common adventuress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The latter is true, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. She has <i>le clou</i> for the <i>eponge d&rsquo;or</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not follow that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;she has the attraction for those who hold the golden
      sponge&mdash;the Ministers of State. Our argot is difficult for you,
      m&rsquo;sieur&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see! Your expressions are a kind of cipher, unintelligible to the
      ordinary person&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so. If I exclaim, <i>par exemple, tarte</i>, it means false; if I
      say <i>gilet de flanelle</i>, it is lemonade; if I say <i>frise</i>, it
      means a Jew; or <i>casserole</i>, which is in our own tongue a police
      officer. So you see it is a little difficult&mdash;is it not? To us <i>tire-jus</i>
      is a handkerchief, and we call the ville de Paris <i>Pantruche</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh sat in wonder. It was certainly a strange experience to be on a
      moonlight ramble with a girl thief who had, according to her own
      confession, been born in Paris the daughter of a man who was still one of
      Il Passero&rsquo;s clever and desperate band.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; she said a few moments later. &ldquo;They are all dangerous.
      They do not fear to use the knife or automatic pistol when cornered. For
      myself, I simply move about Europe and make discoveries as to where little
      affairs can be negotiated. I tell Il Passero, and he then works out the
      plans. <i>Dieu</i>! But I had a narrow escape the other day in Orleans!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell me about Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo. I beg of you to tell me
      something, Mademoiselle Lisette,&rdquo; Hugh urged, turning to the girl of many
      adventures who was seated at his side upon the big rock overlooking the
      ravine down which the bright moon was shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would if I were permitted,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Yvonne is
      charming. You know her, so I need say nothing, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is clever&mdash;very clever,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;As Il Passero is
      clever, so is she.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is actively associated with him&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She is cognizant of all his movements, and of all his plans. While
      she moves in one sphere&mdash;often in a lower sphere, like myself&mdash;yet
      in society she moves in the higher sphere, and she &lsquo;indicates,&rsquo; just as I
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she is one of The Sparrow&rsquo;s associates?&rdquo; Hugh said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;From what you have told me I gather that Il Passero
      knew by one of his many secret sources of information that you were in
      danger of arrest, and sent Paolo to rescue you&mdash;which he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt that is so. But why should he take all this interest in me? I
      don&rsquo;t know and have never even met him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Il Passero is always courteous. He assists the weak against the strong.
      He is like your English bandit Claude Duval of the old days. He always
      robs with exquisite courtesy, and impresses the same trait upon all who
      are in his service. And I may add that all are well paid and all devoted
      to their great master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard that he has a house in London,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;Do you know
      where it is situated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere near Piccadilly. But I do not know exactly where it is. He is
      always vague regarding his address. His letters he receives in several
      names at a newspaper shop in Hammersmith and at the Poste Restante at
      Charing Cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What names?&rdquo; asked Hugh, highly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a number. They are always being changed,&rdquo; the French girl replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you write when you want to communicate with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Generally to the Poste Restante in the Avenue de l&rsquo;Opera, in Paris.
      Letters received there are collected for him and forwarded every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so clever is he that nobody suspects him&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, m&rsquo;sieur. His policy is always &lsquo;<i>Rengraciez</i>!&rsquo; and he cares
      not a single <i>rotin</i> for <i>La Reniffe</i>,&rdquo; she replied, dropping
      again into the slang of French thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is on friendly terms with Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo?&rdquo; Hugh
      remarked. &ldquo;He may have been at Monte Carlo on the night of the tragic
      affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have been. He was, no doubt, somewhere on the Riviera, and he sent
      Paolo in one of the cars to rescue you from the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, he at least knows that I am innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And he probably knows the guilty person. That would account for the
      interest he takes in you, though you do not know him,&rdquo; said Lisette. &ldquo;I
      have known Il Passero perform many kindly acts to persons in distress who
      have never dreamed that they have received money from a notorious
      international thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in my case he has, no doubt, done me signal service,&rdquo; young Henfrey
      replied. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;why cannot you tell me something more
      concerning Mademoiselle? What did you mean by saying that she was a <i>marque
      de ce</i>? I know it is your slang, but won&rsquo;t you explain what it means?
      You have explained most of your other expressions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the girl thief was obdurate. She was certainly a <i>chic</i> and
      engaging little person, apparently well educated and refined, but she was
      as sly as her notorious employer, whom she served so faithfully. She was,
      she had already told Hugh, the daughter of a man who had made jewel thefts
      his speciality and after many convictions was now serving ten years at the
      convict prison at Toulon. She had been bred in the Montmartre, and trained
      and educated to a criminal life. Il Passero had found her, and, after
      several times successfully &ldquo;indicating&rdquo; where coups could be made, she had
      been taken into his employment as a decoy, frequently travelling on the
      international <i>wagon-lits</i> and restaurants, where she succeeded in
      attracting the attention of men and holding them in conversation with a
      mild flirtation while other members of the gang investigated the contents
      of their valises. From one well-known diamond dealer travelling between
      Paris and Amsterdam, she and the man working with her had stolen a packet
      containing diamonds of the value of two hundred thousand francs, while
      from an English business man travelling from Boulogne to Paris, two days
      later, she had herself taken a wallet containing nearly four thousand
      pounds in English bank-notes. It was her share of the recent robbery that
      Il Passero had paid her three days before at the Concordia Restaurant in
      the Via Garibaldi, in Genoa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh pressed her many times to tell him something concerning the
      mysterious Mademoiselle, but he failed to elicit any further information
      of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her fortune at the Rooms is wonderful, they say,&rdquo; Lisette said. &ldquo;She must
      be very rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is one of Il Passero&rsquo;s assistants&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; was her enigmatical reply. &ldquo;Who knows? It is, however, evident
      that Il Passero is seriously concerned at the tragic affair at the Villa
      Amette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever been there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a few moments, then said: &ldquo;Yes, once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know the old Italian servant Cataldi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She replied in the affirmative. Then she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him, but I do not like him. She trusts him, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not. I should be afraid, for to my knowledge he is a <i>saigneur
      a musique</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An assassin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Henfrey. &ldquo;Is he guilty of murder&mdash;and Mademoiselle
      knows it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle may not know about it. She is probably in ignorance, or she
      would not employ him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her remark was of considerable interest, inasmuch as old Cataldi had
      seemed to be most devoted to his mistress, and entirely trusted by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the circumstances?&rdquo; asked Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But it is not our habit to speak of another&rsquo;s&mdash;well,
      shortcomings,&rdquo; was her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, Mademoiselle should have been told the truth! Does not Il Passero
      know?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There flitted across his mind at that moment the recollection of Dorise.
      What could she think of his disappearance? He longed to write to her, but
      The Sparrow&rsquo;s chauffeur had impressed upon him the serious danger he would
      be running if he wrote to her while she was at Monte Carlo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I question whether he does know. But if he does he would say nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Hugh. &ldquo;Yours is indeed a queer world, mademoiselle. And not
      without interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is full of adventure and excitement, of ups and downs, of constant
      travel and change, and of eternal apprehension of arrest,&rdquo; replied the
      girl, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would tell me something about Yvonne Ferad,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! m&rsquo;sieur, I am not permitted,&rdquo; was her obdurate reply. &ldquo;I am truly
      sorry to hear of the dastardly attack upon her. She once did me a very
      kind and friendly action at a moment when I was in sore need of a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who could have fired the shot, do you think?&rdquo; Henfrey asked. &ldquo;You know
      her friends. Perhaps you know her enemies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Lisette was silent for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied reflectively. &ldquo;She has enemies, I know. But who has
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any person who, to your knowledge, would have any motive to kill
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are several people who hate her. One of them might have done it out
      of revenge. You say you saw nobody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you go and see her at that hour?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wanted her to tell me something&mdash;something of greatest
      importance to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she refused, of course? She keeps her own secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. On the other hand, she was about to disclose to me the information I
      sought when someone fired through the open window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shot might have been intended for you&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly might,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But with what motive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To prevent you from learning the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was on the point of telling me what I wanted to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. And what more likely than someone outside, realizing that
      Mademoiselle was about to make a disclosure, fired at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said that Mademoiselle had enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she has. But I think my theory is the correct one,&rdquo; replied the girl.
      &ldquo;What was it that you asked her to reveal to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, after a brief hesitation, &ldquo;my father died mysteriously
      in London some time ago, and I have reason to believe that she knows the
      truth concerning the sad affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was found in the early morning lying in a doorway in Albemarle
      Street, close to Piccadilly. The only wound found was a slight scratch in
      the palm of the hand. The police constable at first thought he was
      intoxicated, but the doctor, on being called, declared that my father was
      suffering from poison. He was at once taken to St. George&rsquo;s Hospital, but
      an hour later he died without recovering consciousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was your father&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked Lisette in a strangely altered
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henfrey!&rdquo; gasped the girl, starting up at mention of the name. &ldquo;<i>Henfrey</i>!
      And&mdash;and are&mdash;you&mdash;<i>his son</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Hugh. &ldquo;Why? You know about the affair, mademoiselle! Tell
      me all you know,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&mdash;the son of the dead man&mdash;have a
      right to demand the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henfrey!&rdquo; repeated the girl hoarsely in a state of intense agitation.
      &ldquo;Monsieur Henfrey! And&mdash;and to think that I am here&mdash;with you&mdash;<i>his
      son</i>! Ah! forgive me!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;Let us
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shall tell me the truth!&rdquo; cried Hugh excitedly. &ldquo;You know it! You
      cannot deny that you know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All, however, he could get from her were the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;Monsieur Henfrey&rsquo;s son! <i>Surely Il Passero does not know this</i>!&rdquo;

    <p>
      A month of weary anxiety and nervous tension had gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne Ferad had slowly struggled back to health, but the injury to the
      brain had, alas! seriously upset the balance of her mind. Three of the
      greatest French specialists upon mental diseases had seen her and
      expressed little hope of her ever regaining her reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sad affair which the police of Monaco had, by dint of much
      bribery and the telling of many untruths, successfully kept out of the
      newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening after Hugh&rsquo;s disappearance, Monsieur Ogier had called upon
      Dorise Ranscomb&mdash;her mother happily being away at the Rooms at the
      time. In one of the sitting-rooms of the hotel the official of police
      closely questioned the girl, but she, of course made pretense of complete
      ignorance. Naturally Ogier was annoyed at being unable to obtain the
      slightest information, and after being very rude, he told the girl the
      charge against her lover and then left the hotel in undisguised anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ranscomb was very much mystified at Hugh&rsquo;s disappearance, though
      secretly she was very glad. She questioned Brock, but he, on his part,
      expressed himself very much puzzled. A week later, however, Walter
      returned to London, and on the following night Lady Ranscomb and her
      daughter took the train-de-luxe for Boulogne, and duly arrived home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As day followed day, Dorise grew more mystified and still more anxious
      concerning Hugh. What was the truth? She had written to Brussels three
      times, but her letters had elicited no response. He might be already under
      arrest, for aught she knew. Besides, she could not rid herself of the
      recollection of the white cavalier, that mysterious masker who had told
      her of her lover&rsquo;s escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of keen anxiety and overstrung nerves she was compelled to
      meet almost daily, and be civil to, her mother&rsquo;s friend, the odious George
      Sherrard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ranscomb was for ever singing the man&rsquo;s praises, and never weary of
      expressing her surprise at Hugh&rsquo;s unforgivable behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He simply disappeared, and nobody has heard a word of him since!&rdquo; she
      remarked one day as they sat at breakfast. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite certain he&rsquo;s done
      something wrong. I&rsquo;ve never liked him, Dorise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like him, mother, because he hasn&rsquo;t money,&rdquo; remarked the girl
      bitterly. &ldquo;If he were rich and entertained you, you would call him a
      delightful man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorise! What are you saying? What&rsquo;s the good of life without money?&rdquo;
       queried the widow of the great contractor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone can&rsquo;t be rich,&rdquo; the girl averred simply. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
      positively hateful to judge people by their pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, has Hugh written to you?&rdquo; snapped her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise replied in the negative, stifling a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he isn&rsquo;t likely to. He&rsquo;s probably hiding somewhere. I wonder what
      he&rsquo;s done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I&rsquo;m sure of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; was her mother&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;I was chatting about
      it to Mr. Sherrard last night, and he&rsquo;s promised to make inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Mr. Sherrard inquire as much as he likes,&rdquo; cried the girl angrily.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll find nothing against Hugh, except that he&rsquo;s poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! And he&rsquo;s been far too much in your company of late, Dorise. People
      were beginning to talk at Monte Carlo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Let them talk, mother! I don&rsquo;t care a scrap. I&rsquo;m my own mistress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I tell you frankly that I&rsquo;m very glad that we&rsquo;ve seen the last
      of the fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother! You are really horrid!&rdquo; cried the girl, rising abruptly and
      leaving the table. When out of the room she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor girl, her heart was indeed full.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that early on that same morning Hugh Henfrey stepped from
      a train which had brought him from Aix-la-Chapelle to the Gare du Nord, in
      Brussels. He had spent three weeks with the Raveccas, in Genoa, whence he
      had travelled to Milan and Bale, and on into Belgium by way of Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Lisette he had failed to elicit any further facts concerning his
      father&rsquo;s death, though it was apparent that she knew something about it&mdash;something
      she dared not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day following their midnight stroll, he had done all in his power
      to induce her to reveal something at least of the affair, but, alas! to no
      avail. Then, two days later, she had suddenly left&mdash;at orders of The
      Sparrow, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Hugh left Ravecca had given him eighty pounds in English notes,
      saying that he acted at Il Passero&rsquo;s orders, for Hugh would no doubt need
      the money, and it would be most dangerous for him to write to his bankers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Henfrey protested, but, as his funds were nearly exhausted, he
      had accepted the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he left the station in Brussels on that bright spring morning and
      crossed the busy Place, he was wondering to what hotel he should go. He
      had left his scanty luggage in the <i>consigne</i>, intending to go out on
      foot and search for some cheap and obscure hotel, there being many such in
      the vicinity of the station. After half an hour he chose a small and
      apparently clean little place in a narrow street off the Place de
      Brouckere, and there, later on, he carried his handbag. Then, after a
      wash, he set out for the Central Post Office in the Place de la Monnaie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not gone far along the busy boulevard when he was startled to hear
      his name uttered from behind, and, turning, encountered a short, thick-set
      little man wearing a brown overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, noticing the effect his words had upon him, smiled reassuringly,
      and said in broken English: &ldquo;It is all right! I am not a police officer,
      Monsieur Henfrey. Cross the road and walk down that street yonder. I will
      follow in a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the man walked on, leaving Hugh alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much surprised, Hugh did as he was bid, and a few minutes later the
      Belgian met him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very dangerous for us to be seen together,&rdquo; he said quickly,
      scarcely pausing as he walked. &ldquo;Do not go near the Post Office, but go
      straight to 14 Rue Beyaert, first floor. I shall be there awaiting you. I
      have a message for you from a friend. You will find the street close to
      the Porte de Hal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the man continued on his way, leaving Hugh in wonder. He had been on
      the point of turning from the boulevard into the Place de la Monnaie to
      obtain Dorise&rsquo;s long looked for letter. Indeed, he had been hastening his
      footsteps full of keen apprehension when the stranger had accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in accordance with the man&rsquo;s suggestion, he turned back towards the
      station, where he entered a taxi and drove across the city to the corner
      of Rue Beyaert, a highly respectable thoroughfare. He experienced no
      difficulty in finding the house indicated, and on ascending the stairs,
      found the stranger awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come in! I am glad that I discovered you! I have been
      awaiting your arrival from Italy for the past fortnight. It is indeed
      fortunate that I found you in time to warn you not to go to the Poste
      Restante.&rdquo; He spoke in French, and had shown his visitor into a small but
      well furnished room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Hugh. &ldquo;Is there danger in that quarter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Monsieur Henfrey. The French police have, by some unknown means,
      discovered that you were coming here, and a strict watch is being kept for
      anyone calling for letters addressed to Godfrey Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could they know?&rdquo; asked Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That is the mystery! Perhaps your lady friend has been indiscreet.
      She was told in strict confidence, and was warned that your safety was in
      her hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, Dorise would be most careful not to betray me!&rdquo; cried the young
      Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, somebody undoubtedly has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume you are one of Il Passero&rsquo;s friends?&rdquo; Hugh said with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Hence I am your friend,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard of late how Mademoiselle Yvonne is progressing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man, who told his visitor his name was Jules Vervoort, shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is no better. I heard last week that the doctors have said that she
      will never recover her mental balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Is she demented?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The report I had was that she recognized nobody, except at intervals
      she knows her Italian manservant and calls him by name. I was ordered to
      tell you this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ordered by Il Passero&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man Vervoort nodded in the affirmative. Then he went on to warn his
      visitor that the Brussels police were on the eager watch for his arrival.
      &ldquo;It is fortunate that you were not recognized when you came this morning,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;I had secret warning and was at the station, but I dared not
      approach you. You passed under the very nose of two detectives, but
      luckily for you, their attention had been diverted to a woman who is a
      well-known pickpocket. I followed you to your hotel and then waited for
      you to go to the Poste Restante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want my letters,&rdquo; said Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, but it is far too dangerous to go near there. You, of course,
      want news of your lady friend. That you will have by special messenger
      very soon. Therefore remain patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are all these precautions being taken to prevent my arrest?&rdquo; Hugh
      asked. &ldquo;I confess I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I. But when Il Passero commands we all obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, I presume, his agent in Brussels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His friend&mdash;not his agent,&rdquo; Vervoort replied with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Mademoiselle Lisette?&rdquo; Hugh asked. &ldquo;She was with me in
      Genoa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We have met. A very clever little person. Il Passero thinks very
      highly of her. She has been educated in the higher schools, and is perhaps
      one of our cleverest decoys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now look here, Monsieur Vervoort,&rdquo; he exclaimed at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much
      in the dark about all this curious business. Lisette knows a lot
      concerning Mademoiselle Yvonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitted. She acted once as her maid, I believe, in some big affair. But
      I don&rsquo;t know much about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know what happened at the Villa Amette that night? Have you any
      idea of the identity of the person who shot poor Mademoiselle&mdash;the
      lady they call Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;All I know is that Il Passero has some
      very keen and personal interest in the affair. He has sent further orders
      to you. It is imperative, he says, that you should get away from Brussels.
      The police are too keen here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggest that you go at once to Malines. Go to Madame Maupoil, 208 Rue
      de Stassart, opposite the Military Hospital. It is far too dangerous for
      you to remain here in Brussels. I have already written that you are
      coming. Her house is one of the sanctuaries of the friends of Il Passero.
      Remember the name and address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sparrow seems to be ubiquitous,&rdquo; Hugh remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is. No really great robbery can be accomplished unless he plans and
      finances it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think why he takes so keen an interest in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He often does in persons who are quite ignorant of his existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my own case. I never heard of him until I was in Genoa, a
      fugitive,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;But you told me I shall receive a message from Miss
      Ranscomb by special messenger. When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are in Malines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this is very strange. Will the mysterious messenger call upon
      Miss Ranscomb in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Il Passero has several messengers who travel to and fro in
      secret. Mademoiselle Lisette was once one of them. She has travelled many
      times the length and breadth of Europe. But nowadays she is an indicator&mdash;and
      a very clever one indeed,&rdquo; he added with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I had better get away to Malines without delay?&rdquo; Hugh remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Go to your hotel, pay them for your room and get your valise. I
      shall be waiting for you at noon in a car in the Rue Gretry, close to the
      Palais d&rsquo;Ete. Then we can slip away to Malines. Have you sufficient money?
      If not, I can give you some. Il Passero has ordered me to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied Hugh. &ldquo;I have enough for the present. My only desire is
      to be back again in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I am afraid that is not possible for some time to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall hear from Miss Ranscomb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. The messenger will come to you in Malines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the messenger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that I have no knowledge,&rdquo; was Vervoort&rsquo;s reply. He seemed a very
      refined man, and was no doubt an extremely clever crook. He said little of
      himself, but sufficient to cause Hugh to realize that his was one of the
      master minds of underground Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Englishman was naturally eager to further penetrate the veil of
      mystery surrounding Mademoiselle Yvonne, but he learned little or nothing.
      Vervoort either knew nothing, or else refused to disclose what he knew.
      Which, Hugh could not exactly decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, in accordance with the Belgian&rsquo;s instructions, he left the
      house and at noon carried his valise to the Rue Gretry, where he found his
      friend awaiting him in a closed car, which quickly moved off out of the
      city by the Laeken road. Travelling by way of Vilvorde they were within an
      hour in old-world Malines, famous for its magnificent cathedral and its
      musical carillon. Crossing the Louvain Canal and entering by the Porte de
      Bruxelles, they were soon in an inartistic cobbled street under the shadow
      of St. Rombold, and a few minutes later Hugh was introduced to a short,
      stout Belgian woman, Madame Maupoil. The place was meagrely furnished, but
      scrupulously clean. The floor of the room to which Hugh was shown shone
      with beeswax, and the walls were whitewashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope monsieur will make himself quite comfortable,&rdquo; madame said, a
      broad smile of welcome upon her round face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be comfortable enough under madame&rsquo;s care,&rdquo; Vervoort assured
      him. &ldquo;She has had some well-known guests before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, monsieur. More than one of them have been world-famous and&mdash;well&mdash;believed
      to be perfectly honest and upright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed Vervoort. &ldquo;Do you remember the English ex-member of
      Parliament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! He was with me nearly four months when supposed to be in South
      America. There was a warrant out for him on account of some great
      financial frauds&mdash;all of which was, of course, hushed up. But he
      stayed here in strict concealment and his friends managed to get the
      warrant withdrawn. He was known to Il Passero, and the latter aided him&mdash;in
      return for certain facilities regarding the English police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of the English police, madame?&rdquo; Hugh asked. The fat
      woman grinned expressively and shrugged her broad shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the war they have been effete as regards serious crime. At least,
      that is what Il Passero told me when he was here a month ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone is coming here to meet Monsieur Henfrey,&rdquo; Vervoort said. &ldquo;Who is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I only received word of it the day before yesterday. A
      messenger from London, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, each day I become more and more mystified,&rdquo; Hugh declared. &ldquo;Why Il
      Passero, whom I do not know, should take all this interest in me, I cannot
      imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Il Passero very often assists those against whom a false charge is laid,&rdquo;
       the woman remarked. &ldquo;There is no better friend when one is in trouble, for
      so clever and ubiquitous is he, and so many friends in high quarters does
      he possess, that he can usually work his will. His is the master-mind, and
      we obey without question.&rdquo;

      TWELFTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE STRANGER IN BOND STREET
    </h3>
    <p>
      As Dorise walked up Bond Street, smartly dressed, next afternoon, on her
      way to her dressmaker&rsquo;s, she was followed by a well-dressed young girl in
      black, dark-eyed, with well-cut, refined features, and apparently a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Piccadilly the stranger had followed Dorise unseen, until at the
      corner of Maddox Street she overtook her, and smiling, uttered her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Doris in surprise. &ldquo;But I regret&mdash;you have the
      advantage of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; replied the stranger. &ldquo;Do you recollect the <i>bal blanc</i>
      at Nice and a certain white cavalier? I have a message from him to give
      you in secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in secret?&rdquo; Dorise asked rather defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;for certain reasons which I think you can guess,&rdquo; answered the
      girl in black, as she strolled at Dorise&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did not you call on me at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of your mother. She would probably have been a little
      inquisitive. Let us go into some place&mdash;a tea-room&mdash;where we can
      talk,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;I have come to see you concerning Mr. Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Dorise, in an instant anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite safe. He arrived in Malines yesterday&mdash;and is with friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he had my letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, no. But do not let us talk here. Let&rsquo;s go in yonder,&rdquo; and
      she indicated the Laurel Tea Rooms, which, the hour being early, they
      found, to their satisfaction, practically deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a table in the far corner they resumed their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why has he not received my letters?&rdquo; asked Dorise. &ldquo;It is nearly a month
      ago since I first wrote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By some mysterious means the police got to know of your friend&rsquo;s intended
      visit to Brussels to obtain his letters. Therefore, it was too dangerous
      for him to go to the Poste Restante, or even to send anyone there. The
      Brussels police were watching constantly. How they have gained their
      knowledge is a complete mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sent you to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of Mr. Henfrey. My instructions are to see you, and to convey
      any message you may wish to send to Mr. Henfrey to him direct in Malines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s awfully good of you,&rdquo; Dorise replied. &ldquo;Does he know you are
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But I have not met him. I am simply a messenger. In fact, I travel
      far and wide for those who employ me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret, but they must remain nameless,&rdquo; said the girl, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise was puzzled as to how the French police could have gained any
      knowledge of Hugh&rsquo;s intentions. Then suddenly, she became horrified as a
      forgotten fact flashed across her mind. She recollected how, early in the
      grey morning, after her return from the ball at Nice, she had written and
      addressed a letter to Hugh. On reflection, she had realized that it was
      not sufficiently reassuring, so she had torn it up and thrown it into the
      waste-paper basket instead of burning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, she remembered, addressed the envelope to Mr. Godfrey Brown, at
      the Poste Restante in Brussels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that the torn fragments had fallen into the hands of the
      police? She knew that they had been watching her closely. Her surmise was,
      as a matter of fact, the correct one. Ogier had employed the head
      chambermaid to give him the contents of Dorise&rsquo;s waste-paper basket from
      time to time, hence the knowledge he had gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you actually going to Malines?&rdquo; asked Dorise of the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. As your messenger,&rdquo; the other replied with a smile. &ldquo;I am leaving
      to-night. If you care to write him a letter, I will deliver it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come with me over to the Empress Club, and I will write the
      letter there?&rdquo; Dorise suggested, still entirely mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this the stranger agreed, and they left the tea-shop and walked
      together to the well-known ladies&rsquo; club, where, while the mysterious
      messenger sipped tea, Dorise sat down and wrote a long and affectionate
      letter to her lover, urging him to exercise the greatest caution and to
      get back to London as soon as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had finished it, she placed it in an envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not address it,&rdquo; remarked the other girl. &ldquo;It will be safer
      blank, for I shall give it into his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And ten minute later the mysterious girl departed, leaving Dorise to
      reflect over the curious encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Hugh was in Malines. She went to the telephone, rang up Walter Brock,
      and told him the reassuring news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Malines?&rdquo; he cried over the wire. &ldquo;I wonder if I dare go there to see
      him? What a dead-alive hole!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not until then did Dorise recollect that the girl had not given her Hugh&rsquo;s
      address. She had, perhaps, purposely withheld it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fact she told Hugh&rsquo;s friend, who replied over the wire:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is highly satisfactory news, in any case. We can only wait, Miss
      Ranscomb. But this must relieve your mind, I feel sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it does,&rdquo; admitted Dorise, and a few moments later she rang off.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Il Passero&rsquo;s <i>chic</i> messenger crossed from Dover to
      Ostend, and next morning she called at Madame Maupoil&rsquo;s, in Malines, where
      she delivered Dorise&rsquo;s note into Hugh&rsquo;s own hand. She was an expert and
      hardened traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh eagerly devoured its contents, for it was the first communication he
      had had from her since that fateful night at Monte Carlo. Then, having
      thanked the girl again, and again, the latter said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish to write back to Miss Ranscomb do so. I will address the
      envelope, and as I am going to Cologne to-night I will post it on my
      arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh thanked her cordially, and while she sat chatting with Madame
      Maupoil, sipping her <i>cafe au lait</i>, he sat down and wrote a long
      letter to the girl he loved so deeply&mdash;a letter which reached its
      destination four days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning about ten days afterwards, when the sun shone brightly upon
      the fresh green of the Surrey hills, Mrs. Bond was sitting before a fire
      in the pretty morning room at Shapley Manor, a room filled with antique
      furniture and old blue china, reading an illustrated paper. At the long,
      leaded window stood a tall, fair-faced girl in a smart navy-suit. She was
      decidedly pretty, with large, soft grey eyes, dimpled cheeks, and a small,
      well-formed mouth. She gazed abstractedly out of the window over the
      beautiful panorama to where Hindhead rose abruptly in the blue distance.
      The view from the moss-grown terrace at Shapley, high upon the Hog&rsquo;s back,
      was surely one of the finest within a couple of hundred miles of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Mrs. Bond&rsquo;s arrival there she had had many callers among the <i>nouveau
      riche</i>, those persons who, having made money at the expense of our
      gallant British soldiers, have now ousted half the county families from
      their solid and responsible homes. Mrs. Bond, being wealthy, had displayed
      her riches ostentatiously. She had subscribed lavishly to charities both
      in Guildford and in Farnham, and hence, among her callers there had been
      at least three magistrates and their flat-footed wives, as well as a
      plethoric alderman, and half a dozen insignificant persons possessing
      minor titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The display of wealth had always been one of Molly Maxwell&rsquo;s games. It
      always paid. She knew that to succeed one must spend, and now, with her
      recently acquired &ldquo;fortune,&rdquo; she spent to a very considerable tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish you&rsquo;d go in the car to Guildford and exchange those library
      books, Louise,&rdquo; exclaimed the handsome woman, suddenly looking up from her
      paper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got those horrid Brailsfords coming to lunch. I was bound to
      ask them back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you come, too?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I expect Mr. Benton this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he was back from Paris. I&rsquo;m so glad he&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; replied
      the girl. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll stay all the afternoon, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. Go at once and get back as soon as you can, dear. Choose me
      some nice new books, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louise Lambert, Benton&rsquo;s adopted daughter, turned from the leaded window.
      In the strong morning light she looked extremely charming, but upon her
      countenance there was a deep, thoughtful expression, as though she were
      entirely preoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking of Hugh Henfrey,&rdquo; the woman remarked suddenly. &ldquo;I
      wonder why he never writes to you?&rdquo; she added, watching the girl&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise&rsquo;s cheeks reddened slightly, as she replied with affected
      carelessness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t care to write, I shall trouble no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s still abroad, is he not? The last I heard of him was that he was at
      Monte Carlo with that Ranscomb girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mention of Dorise Ranscomb caused the girl&rsquo;s cheeks to colour more deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I heard that also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to care very much, Louise,&rdquo; remarked the woman. &ldquo;And yet,
      he&rsquo;s such an awfully nice young fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said that dozens of times before,&rdquo; was Louise&rsquo;s abrupt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I mean it. You could do a lot worse than to marry him, remember,
      though he is a bit hard-up nowadays. But things with him will right
      themselves before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you suggest that?&rdquo; asked the girl resentfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;because, my dear, I know that you are very fond of him,&rdquo; the
      woman laughed. &ldquo;Now, you can&rsquo;t deny it&mdash;can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl, who had travelled so widely ever since she had left school, drew
      a deep breath and, turning her head, gazed blankly out of the window
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Mrs. Bond had said was her secret. She was very fond of Hugh. They
      had not met very often, but he had attracted her&mdash;a fact of which
      both Benton and his female accomplice were well aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t reply,&rdquo; laughed the woman for whom the Paris Surete was
      searching everywhere; &ldquo;but your face betrays the truth, my dear. Don&rsquo;t
      worry,&rdquo; she added in a tone of sympathy. &ldquo;No doubt he&rsquo;ll write as soon as
      he is back in England. Personally, I don&rsquo;t believe he really cares a rap
      for the Ranscomb girl. It&rsquo;s only a matter of money&mdash;and Dorise has
      plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to hear anything about Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s love affairs!&rdquo; cried
      the girl petulantly. &ldquo;I tell you that they do not interest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are piqued that he does not write, child. Ah, dear, I know!&rdquo;
       she laughed, as the girl left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later Louise was seated in the car, while Mead drove
      her along the broad highway over the Hog&rsquo;s Back into Guildford. The
      morning was delightful, the trees wore their spring green, and all along
      in the fields, as they went over the high ridge, the larks were singing
      gaily the music of a glad morning of the English spring, and the view
      spread wide on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life in Surrey was, she found, much preferable to that on the Continent.
      True, in the Rue Racine they had entertained a great deal, and she had,
      during the war, met many very pleasant young English and American
      officers; but the sudden journey to Switzerland, then on into Italy, and
      across to New York, had been a whirl of excitement. Mrs. Maxwell had
      changed her name several times, because she said that she did not want her
      divorced husband, a ne&rsquo;er-do-well, to know of her whereabouts. He was for
      ever molesting her, she had told Louise, and for that reason she had
      passed in different names.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was in complete ignorance of the truth. She never dreamed that
      the source of the woman&rsquo;s wealth was highly suspicious, or that the
      constant travelling was in order to evade the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was driven along, she sat back reflecting. Truth to tell, she was
      much in love with Hugh. Benton had first introduced him one night at the
      Spa in Scarborough, and after that they had met several times on the
      Esplanade, then again in London, and once in Paris. Yet while she, on her
      part, became filled with admiration, he was, apparently, quite unconscious
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she had heard of Hugh&rsquo;s infatuation for Dorise Ranscomb, the
      daughter of the great engineer who had recently died, and indeed she had
      met her once and been introduced to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the conditions of old Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s will she was, of course, in
      ignorance. The girl had no idea of the great plot which had been formed by
      her foster father and his clever female friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world is a strange one beneath the surface of things. Those who passed
      the imposing gates of the beautiful old English manor-house never dreamed
      that it sheltered one of the most notorious female criminals in Europe.
      And the worshipful magistrates and their wives who visited her would have
      received a rude shock had they but known. But many modern adventuresses
      have been able to bamboozle the mighty. Madame Humbert of Paris, in whose
      imagination were &ldquo;The Humbert Millions,&rdquo; used to entertain Ministers of
      State, aristocrats, financiers, and others of lower degree, and show them
      the sealed-up safe in which she declared reposed millions&rsquo; worth of
      negotiable securities which might not see the light of day until a certain
      date. The avaricious, even shrewd, bankers advanced loans upon things they
      had never seen, and the Humberts were the most sought-after family in
      Paris until the bubble burst and they fled and were afterwards arrested in
      Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly Maxwell was a marvel of ingenuity, of criminal foresight, and of
      amazing elusiveness. Louise, young and unsuspicious, looked upon her as a
      mother. Benton she called &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; and was always grateful to him for all
      he did for her. She understood that they were cousins, and that Benton
      advised Mrs. Maxwell in her disastrous matrimonial affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the life she had led ever since leaving school had been a truly
      adventurous one. She had been in half the watering places of Europe, and
      in most of its capitals, leading, with the woman who now called herself
      Mrs. Bond, a most extravagant life at hotels of the first order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car at last ran into the station yard at Guildford, and at the
      bookstall Louise exchanged her books with the courteous manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was passing through the booking-office back to the car, when a voice
      behind her called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Louise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning, she found her &ldquo;uncle,&rdquo; Charles Benton, who, wearing a light
      overcoat and grey velour hat, grasped her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This is fortunate. Mead is here, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, uncle,&rdquo; replied the girl, much gratified at meeting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to engage a taxi to take me up to the Manor, but now you can
      take me there,&rdquo; said the rather handsome man. &ldquo;How is Mrs. Bond?&rdquo; he
      asked, calling her by her new name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well. She&rsquo;s expecting you to lunch. But she has some impossible
      people there to-day&mdash;the Brailsfords, father, mother, and son. He
      made his money in motor-cars during the war. They live over at Dorking in
      a house with forty-nine bedrooms, and only fifteen years ago Mrs.
      Brailsford used to do the housework herself. Now they&rsquo;re rolling in money,
      but can&rsquo;t keep servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear, it&rsquo;s the same everywhere,&rdquo; said Benton as he entered the car
      after her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got back from Madrid. It is the same there. The
      world is changing. Crooks prosper while white men starve. Honesty spells
      ruin in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove over the railway bridge and up the steep hill out of Guildford
      seated side by side. Benton had been her &ldquo;uncle&rdquo; ever since her childhood
      days, and a most kind and considerate one he had always proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes when at school she did not see him for periods of a year or more
      and she had no home to go to for holidays. Her foster-father was abroad.
      Yet her school fees were paid regularly, her allowance had been ample, and
      her clothes were always slightly better than those of the other girls.
      Therefore, though she called him &ldquo;uncle,&rdquo; she looked upon Benton as her
      father and obeyed all his commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just about noon the car swung into the gates of Shapley, and soon they
      were indoors. Benton threw off his coat, and in an abrupt manner said to
      the servant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Mrs. Bond at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to Louise, he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Molly privately. I have some urgent business to discuss
      with her before your profiteer friends arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied the girl cheerily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you alone,&rdquo; and she
      ascended the broad oak staircase, the steps of which were worn thin by the
      tramp of many generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Charles Benton stood in the morning-room, where Mrs.
      Bond still sat before the welcome log fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back again, Charles!&rdquo; she exclaimed, rising to greet him. &ldquo;Well, how goes
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too well,&rdquo; was his reply as he closed the door. &ldquo;I only got back last
      night. Five days ago I saw The Sparrow at the Palace Hotel in Madrid. He&rsquo;s
      doing all he can in young Henfrey&rsquo;s interests, but he is not too hopeful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out,&rdquo; said the man, apparently much perturbed. &ldquo;He wired me
      to go to Madrid, and I went. But it seems that I&rsquo;ve been on a fool&rsquo;s
      errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very unsatisfactory,&rdquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, my dear Molly! From his attitude it seemed to me that he is
      protecting Henfrey from some secret motive of his own&mdash;one that is
      not at all in accordance with our plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is surely acting in our interests!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;m not so sure about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surprise me. He knows our intentions and approved of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His approval has, I think, been upset by the murderous attack upon
      Yvonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he surely will not act against us! If he does&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does&mdash;then we may as well throw up the sponge, Molly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could give it all away to the police,&rdquo; remarked the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by so doing give ourselves away!&rdquo; answered Benton. &ldquo;The Sparrow has
      many friends in the police, recollect. Abroad, he distributes a quantity
      of annual <i>douceurs</i>, and hence he is practically immune from
      arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we were,&rdquo; laughed the handsome adventuress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We have only to dance to his tune,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And the tune just now
      is not one which is pleasing to us&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem strangely apprehensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. I believe that The Sparrow, while making pretence of supporting our
      little affair, is in favour of Hugh&rsquo;s marriage with Dorise Ranscomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked him straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could never go back on his word!&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sparrow is a curious combination of the crook&mdash;chivalrous and
      philanthropic&mdash;as you already know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely, he wouldn&rsquo;t let us down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benton paused. He was thinking deeply. A certain fact had suddenly
      occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does, then we must, I suppose, do our best to expose him. I happen
      to know that he has quarrelled with Henri Michaux, the under-secretary of
      the Surete in Paris, who has declared that his payment is not sufficient.
      Michaux is anxious to get even with him. A word from us would result in
      The Sparrow&rsquo;s arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly. &ldquo;If we fail we can, after all, have our
      revenge. But,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;would not he suspect us both, and, in turn,
      give us away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He will never suspect, my dear Molly. Leave it to me. Are we not his
      dearest and most trusted friends?&rdquo; and the man, who was as keenly sought
      by the police of Europe, grinned sardonically and took a cigarette from
      the big silver box on the little table at his elbow.

      THIRTEENTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      POISONED LIPS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Week after week passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring was slowly developing into summer and the woods around Blairglas,
      the fine estate in Perthshire which old Sir Richard Ranscomb had left to
      his wife, were delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blairglas Castle, a grand old turreted pile, was perched on the edge of a
      wooded glen through which flowed a picturesque burn well known to tourists
      in Scotland. Once Blairglas Burn had been a mighty river which had, in the
      bygone ages, worn its way deep through the grey granite down to the broad
      Tay and onward to the sea. On the estate was some excellent
      salmon-fishing, as well as grouse on Blairglas Moor, and trout in
      Blairglas Loch. Here Lady Ranscomb entertained her wealthy Society
      friends, and certainly she did so lavishly and well. Twice each year she
      went up for the fishing and for the shooting. Old Sir Richard,
      notwithstanding his gout, had been fond of sport, and for that reason he
      had given a fabulous price for the place, which had belonged to a certain
      Duke who, like others, had become impoverished by excessive taxation and
      the death duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built in the fifteenth century as a fortress, it was, for a time, the home
      of James V. after his marriage with Mary of Guise. It was to Blairglas
      that, after his defeat on Solway Moss, he retired, subsequently dying of a
      broken heart. Twenty years later Darnley, the elegant husband of Mary
      Stuart, had lived there, and on the level bowling green he used to indulge
      in his favourite sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grim old place, with its towers, its dimly-lit long stone corridors,
      cyclopean ivy-clad walls, narrow windows, and great panelled chambers,
      breathed an atmosphere of the long ago. So extensive was it that only one
      wing&mdash;that which looked far down the glen to the blue distant
      mountains&mdash;had been modernised; yet that, in itself, was sufficiently
      spacious for the entertainment of large house-parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, early in June, Dorise, in a rough tweed suit and a pearl-grey
      suede tam-o&rsquo;shanter, carrying a mackintosh across her shoulder, and
      accompanied by a tall, dark-haired, clean-shaven man of thirty-two, with
      rather thick lips and bushy eyebrows, walked down through the woods to the
      river. The man, who was in fishing clothes, sauntered at her side, smoking
      a cigarette; while behind them came old Sandy Murray, the grizzled,
      fair-bearded head keeper, carrying the salmon rods, the gaff, creel, and
      luncheon basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spate is excellent for us,&rdquo; exclaimed George Sherrard. &ldquo;We ought to
      kill a salmon to-day, Dorise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sincerely hope so,&rdquo; replied the girl; &ldquo;but somehow I never have any
      luck in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you really don&rsquo;t! But Marjorie killed a twelve-pounder last week,
      your mother tells me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She went out with Murray every day for a whole fortnight, and then
      on the day before she went back to town she landed a splendid fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On arrival at the bank of the broad shallow Tay, Murray stepped forward,
      and in his pleasant Perthshire accent suggested that a trial might be made
      near the Ardcraig, a short walk to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      After fixing the rods and baiting them, the head keeper discreetly
      withdrew, leaving the pair alone. In the servants&rsquo; hall at Blairglas it
      was quite understood that Miss Dorise and Mr. Sherrard were to marry, and
      that the announcement would be made in due course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely day&mdash;and what a silent, delightful spot,&rdquo; Sherrard
      remarked, as he filled his pipe preparatory to walking up-stream, while
      the girl remained beside the dark pool where sport seemed likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, inwardly wishing to get rid of her companion so as to
      be left alone with her own thoughts. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remain here for a little and
      then go down-stream to the end of our water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right oh!&rdquo; he replied cheerily as he moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise breathed more freely when he had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Sherrard had arrived from London quite unexpectedly at nine o&rsquo;clock
      on the previous morning. She had been alone with her mother after the last
      guest of a gay house-party had departed, when, unknown to Dorise, Lady
      Ranscomb had telegraphed to her friend George to &ldquo;run up for a few days&rsquo; 
      fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ranscomb&rsquo;s scheme was to throw the pair into each other&rsquo;s society as
      much as possible. She petted George, flattered him, and in every way tried
      to entertain him with one sole object, namely, to induce him to propose to
      Dorise, and so get the girl &ldquo;off her hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, the girl&rsquo;s thoughts were for ever centred upon Hugh, even
      though he remained under that dark cloud of suspicion. To her the chief
      element in the affair was the mystery why her lover had gone on that
      fateful night to the Villa Amette, the house of that notorious
      Mademoiselle. What had really occurred?
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice she had received letters from him brought to her by the mysterious
      girl-messenger from Belgium. From them she knew how grey and dull was his
      life, hiding there from those who were so intent upon his arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, within her blouse she carried his last letter which she had
      received three weeks before when in London&mdash;a letter in which he
      implored her not to misjudge him, and in which he promised that, as soon
      as he dared to leave his hiding-place and meet her, he would explain
      everything. In return, she had again written to him, but though three
      weary weeks had passed, she had received no word in reply. She could
      neither write by post, nor could she telegraph. It was far too dangerous.
      In addition, his address had been purposely withheld from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter Brock had tried to ascertain it. He had even seen the mysterious
      messenger on her last visit to England, but she had refused point-blank,
      declaring that she had been ordered to disclose nothing. She was merely a
      messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      That her correspondence was still being watched by the police, Dorise was
      quite well aware. Her maid, Duncan, had told her in confidence quite
      recently that while crossing Berkeley Square one evening she had been
      accosted by a good-looking young man who, having pressed his attentions
      upon her, had prevailed upon her to meet him on the following evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then took her to dinner to a restaurant in Soho, and to the pictures
      afterwards. They had met half a dozen times, when he began to cleverly
      question her concerning her mistress, asking whether she had letters from
      her gentleman friends. At this Duncan had grown suspicious, and she had
      not met the young fellow since.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, in itself, showed her that the police were bent on discovering and
      arresting Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great mystery of it all was why Hugh should have gone deliberately and
      clandestinely to the Villa Amette on the night of the tragic affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise was really an expert in casting a fly; also she excelled in several
      branches of sport. She was a splendid tennis-player, she rode well to
      hounds, and was very fair at golf. But that morning she had no heart for
      fishing, and especially in such company. She despised George Sherrard as a
      prig, fond of boasting of his means, and, indeed, so terribly
      self-conscious was he that in many circles he was declared impossible. Men
      disliked him for his swagger and conceit, and women despised him for his
      superior attitude towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a full hour Dorise continued making casts, but in vain. She changed
      her flies once or twice, until at last, by a careless throw, she got her
      tackle hooked high in a willow, with the result that, in endeavouring to
      extricate it, she broke off the hook. Then with an exclamation of
      impatience, she wound up her line and threw her rod upon the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Dorise!&rdquo; cried a voice. &ldquo;No luck, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherrard had returned and had witnessed her outbreak of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None!&rdquo; she snapped, for the loss of her fly annoyed her. She knew that
      she had been careless, because under old Murray&rsquo;s careful tuition she had
      become quite expert with the rod, both with trout and salmon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had similar luck. I&rsquo;ve just got hooked up in
      a root and lost a fly. Let&rsquo;s have lunch&mdash;shall we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorise was in no mood to lunch with her mother&rsquo;s visitor, but,
      nevertheless, was compelled to be polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      After washing their hands in the stream, they sat down together upon a
      great, grey boulder that had been worn smooth by the action of the water,
      and, taking out their sandwiches, began to eat them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; exclaimed Sherrard suddenly, after they had been gossiping
      for some time. &ldquo;Have you heard from your friend Henfrey lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not lately,&rdquo; replied the girl, a trifle resentful that he should obtrude
      upon her private affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only ask because&mdash;well, because there are some jolly queer stories
      going about town of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer stories!&rdquo; she echoed quickly. &ldquo;What are they? What do people say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! They say lots of extraordinary things. I think your mother has done
      very well to drop him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has mother dropped him?&rdquo; asked the girl in pretence of ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me so last night, and I was extremely glad to hear it&mdash;though
      he is your friend. It seems that he&rsquo;s hardly the kind of fellow you should
      know, Dorise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; his companion asked, her eyes flashing instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Haven&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story that&rsquo;s going round the clubs. He&rsquo;s missing, and has been so for
      quite a long time. You haven&rsquo;t seen him&mdash;have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was compelled to reply in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do they say against him?&rdquo; she demanded breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of funny stories,&rdquo; was Sherrard&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;They say he&rsquo;s
      hiding from the police because he attempted to murder a notorious woman
      called Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo. Do you know about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wicked lie!&rdquo; blurted forth the girl. &ldquo;Hugh never attempted to kill
      the woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherrard looked straight into her blue eyes, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why was he in her room at midnight? They say the reason Henfrey is
      hard-up is because he spent all he possessed upon the woman, and on going
      there that night she laughed him to scorn and told him she had grown fond
      of a rich Austrian banker. After mutual recriminations, Henfrey, knowing
      the woman had ruined him, drew out a revolver and shot her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you it&rsquo;s an abominable lie! Hugh is not an assassin!&rdquo; cried the
      girl fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely repeat what I have heard on very good authority,&rdquo; replied the
      smug-faced man with the thick red lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have of course told my mother that&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was any secret,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Indeed, I think it most
      fortunate we all know the truth. The police must get him one day&mdash;before
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments Dorise remained silent, her eyes fixed across the broad
      river to the opposite bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they do, he will most certainly clear himself, Mr. Sherrard,&rdquo; she
      said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You still have great faith in him,&rdquo; he laughed airily. &ldquo;Well&mdash;we
      shall see,&rdquo; and he grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Sherrard. I still have faith in Mr. Henfrey. I know him well
      enough to be certain that he is no assassin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I ask you, Dorise, why is he hiding?&rdquo; said her companion. &ldquo;If he is
      innocent, what can he fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he is innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. You must remain in that belief until he is found guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You already condemn him!&rdquo; the girl cried in anger. &ldquo;By what right do you
      do this, I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, common sense shows that he is in fear lest the truth should come to
      light,&rdquo; was Sherrard&rsquo;s lame reply. &ldquo;He escaped very cleverly from Monte
      Carlo the moment he heard that the police suspected him, but where is he
      now? Nobody knows. Haynes, of Scotland Yard, who made the inquiries when
      my flat in Park Lane was broken into, tells me they have had a description
      of him from the Paris police, and that a general hue-and-cry has been
      circulated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the woman is still alive, is she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s a hopeless idiot, Haynes tells me. She had developed homicidal
      mania as a result of the bullet wound in the head, and they have had to
      send her to a private asylum at Cannes. She&rsquo;s there in close confinement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorise paused. Her anger had risen, and her cheeks were flushed. The
      sandwich she was eating choked her, so she cast it into the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she rose abruptly, and looking very straight into the man&rsquo;s eyes,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider, Mr. Sherrard, that you are absolutely horrid. Mr. Henfrey is
      a friend of mine, and whatever gossip there is concerning him I will not
      believe until I hear his story from his own lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely tell you of the report from France to Scotland Yard,&rdquo; said
      Sherrard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me this in order to prejudice me against Hugh&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh! Whom you love&mdash;eh?&rdquo; sneered Sherrard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I <i>do</i> love him,&rdquo; the girl blurted forth. &ldquo;I make no secret of
      it. And if you like you can tell my mother that! You are very fond of
      acting as her factotum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be regretted, Dorise, that you have fallen in love with a fellow
      who is wanted by the police,&rdquo; he remarked with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, I love a genuine man,&rdquo; she retorted with bitter sarcasm. &ldquo;I
      know my mother&rsquo;s intention is that I shall marry you. But I tell you here
      frankly&mdash;as I stand here&mdash;I would rather kill myself first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Sherrard with his dark bushy brows and thick lips only laughed at
      her indignation. This incensed her the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You may be amused at my distress. You have laughed at
      the distress of other women, Mr. Sherrard. Do not think that I am blind. I
      have watched you, and I know more concerning your love affairs of the past
      than you ever dream. So please leave Blairglas as soon as you can with
      decency excuse yourself, and keep away from me in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But really, Dorise&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; he cried, advancing towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean exactly what I say. Let me get back. When I go fishing I prefer to
      go alone,&rdquo; the girl said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to say to Lady Ranscomb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her that I love Hugh,&rdquo; laughed the girl defiantly. &ldquo;Tell her that I
      intend to defeat all her clever intrigues and sly devices!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His countenance now showed that he was angry. He and Lady Ranscomb
      thoroughly understood each other. He admired the girl, and her mother had
      assured him her affection for Hugh Henfrey was but a passing fancy. This
      stubborn outburst was to him a complete revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no knowledge of any intrigue, Dorise,&rdquo; he said in that bland,
      superior manner which always irritated her. She knew that a dozen mothers
      with eligible feminine encumbrances were trying to angle him, and that
      Lady Ranscomb was greatly envied by them. But to be the wife of the
      self-conscious ass&mdash;well, as she has already bluntly told him, she
      would die rather than become Mrs. George Sherrard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intrigue!&rdquo; the girl retorted. &ldquo;Why, from first to last the whole thing is
      a plot between my mother and yourself. Please give me credit for just a
      little intelligence. First, I despise you as a coward. During the war you
      crept into a little clerkship in the Home Office in order to save your
      precious skin, while Hugh went to the front and risked his life flying a
      &lsquo;bomber&rsquo; over the enemy&rsquo;s lines. You were a miserable stay-at-home, hiding
      in your little bolt-hole in Whitehall when the Zepps came over, while Hugh
      Henfrey fought for his King and for Britain. Now I am quite frank, Mr.
      Sherrard. That&rsquo;s why I despise you!&rdquo; and the girl&rsquo;s pale face showed two
      pink spots in the centre of her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he said in that same superior tone which he so constantly
      assumed. &ldquo;I must say that you are the reverse of polite, Miss Dorise,&rdquo; and
      his colour heightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am! And I intend to be so!&rdquo; she cried in a frenzy, for all her
      affection for Hugh had in those moments been redoubled. Her lover was
      accused and had no chance of self-defence. &ldquo;Go back to my mother,&rdquo; she
      went on. &ldquo;Tell her every word I have said and embroider it as much as you
      like. Then you can both put your wits together a little further. But,
      remember, I shall exert my own woman&rsquo;s wits against yours. And as soon as
      you feel it practicable, I hope you will leave Blairglas. And further, if
      you have not left by noon to-morrow, I will tell my maid, Duncan, the
      whole story of this sinister plot to part me from Hugh. She will spread
      it, I assure you. Maids gossip&mdash;and to a purpose when their
      mistresses will it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dorise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! Mr. Sherrard. I prefer to walk up to the Castle by myself. Murray
      will bring up the rods. Please tell my mother what I say when you get
      back,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;The night train from Perth to London leaves at
      nine-forty to-night,&rdquo; she said with biting sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turning, she began to ascend the steep path which led from the river
      bank into a cornfield and through the wood, while the man stood and bit
      his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he growled beneath his breath. &ldquo;We shall see!&mdash;yes, we shall
      see!&rdquo;

      FOURTEENTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      RED DAWN
    </h3>
    <p>
      That night when Dorise, in a pretty, pale-blue evening gown, entered the
      great, old panelled dining-room rather late for dinner, her mother
      exclaimed petulantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How late you are, dear! Mr. Sherrard has had a telegram recalling him to
      London. He has to catch the nine-something train from Perth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; she asked the man who was odious to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I&rsquo;m
      late, but that Mackenzie girl called. They are getting up a bazaar for the
      old people down in the village, and we have to help it, I suppose. Oh!
      these bazaars, sales of work, and other little excuses for extracting
      shillings from the pockets of everybody! They are most wearying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She called on me last week,&rdquo; said Lady Ranscomb. &ldquo;Newte told her I was
      not at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old-fashioned butler, John Newte, a white-haired, rosy-faced man, who
      had seen forty years&rsquo; service with the ducal owner of Blairglas, served
      the dinner in his own stately style. Sir Richard had been a good master,
      but things had never been the same since the castle had passed into its
      new owner&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise endeavoured to be quite affable to the smooth-haired man seated
      before her, expressing regret that he was called away so suddenly, while
      he, on his part, declared that it was &ldquo;awful hard luck,&rdquo; as he had been
      looking forward to a week&rsquo;s good sport on the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come back, George,&rdquo; Lady Ranscomb urged. &ldquo;Get your business over and
      get back here for the weekend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; was Sherrard&rsquo;s half-hearted response, whereat Newte entered to
      announce that the car was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he bade mother and daughter adieu, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise could see that her mother was considerably annoyed at her plans
      being so abruptly frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must ask somebody else,&rdquo; she said, as they lingered over the dessert.
      &ldquo;Whom shall we ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t care in the least, mother. I&rsquo;m quite happy here alone. It
      is a rest. We shall have to be back in town in a fortnight, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George could quite well have waited for a day or two,&rdquo; Lady Ranscomb
      declared. &ldquo;I went out to see the Muirs, at Forteviot, and when I got back
      he told me he had just had a telegram telling him that it was imperative
      he should be in town to-morrow morning. I tried to persuade him to stay,
      but he declared it to be impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An appointment with a lady, perhaps,&rdquo; laughed Dorise mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next, my dear! You know he is over head and ears in love with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s quite enough, mother. You&rsquo;ve told me that lots of times
      before. But I tell you quite frankly his love leaves me quite cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! dear. That reply is, after all, but natural. You, of course, won&rsquo;t
      confess the truth,&rdquo; her mother laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, mother. I&rsquo;m heartily glad the fellow has gone. I hate his
      supercilious manner, his superior tone, and his unctuous bearing. He&rsquo;s
      simply odious! That&rsquo;s my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother looked at her severely across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please remember, Dorise, that George is my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never forget that,&rdquo; said the girl meaningly, as she rose and left the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, when she entered her bedroom, she found Duncan, her
      maid, awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve been waiting to see you this half hour, miss,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t get you alone. Just before eight o&rsquo;clock, as I was about to enter
      the park by the side gate near Bervie Farm, a gentleman approached me and
      asked if my name was Duncan. I told him it was, and then he gave me this
      to give to you in secret. He also gave me a pound note, miss, to say
      nothing about it.&rdquo; And the prim lady&rsquo;s maid handed her young mistress a
      small white envelope upon which her name was written.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening it, she found a plain visiting card which bore the words in a
      man&rsquo;s handwriting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be possible for you to meet me to-night at ten at the spot where
      I have given this to your maid? Urgent.&mdash;SILVERADO.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorise held her breath. It was a message from the mysterious white
      cavalier who had sought her out at the <i>bal blanc</i> at Nice, and told
      her of Hugh&rsquo;s peril!
    </p>
    <p>
      Duncan was naturally curious owing to the effect the card had had upon her
      mistress, but she was too well trained to make any comment. Instead, she
      busied herself at the wardrobe, and a few moments afterwards left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise stood before the long cheval glass, the card still in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did it mean? Why was the mysterious white cavalier in Scotland? At
      least she would now be able to see his face. It was past nine, and the
      moon was already shining. She had still more than half an hour before she
      went forth to meet the man of mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      She descended to the drawing-room, where her mother was reading, and after
      playing over a couple of songs as a camouflage, she pretended to be tired
      and announced her intention of retiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have to go into Edinburgh to-morrow morning,&rdquo; her mother remarked. &ldquo;So
      we should start pretty early. I&rsquo;ve ordered the car for nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, mother. Good-night,&rdquo; said the girl as she closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then hastening to her room she threw off her dinner gown, and putting on a
      coat and skirt and the boots which she had worn when fishing that morning,
      she went out by a door which led from the great old library, with its
      thousands of brown-backed volumes, on to the broad terrace which
      overlooked the glen, now a veritable fairyland beneath the light of the
      moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the silence was only broken by the ripple of the burn over its
      pebbles deep below, and the cry of the night-bird upon the steep rock
      whereon the historic old castle was built. By a path known to her she
      descended swiftly, and away into the park by yet another path, used almost
      exclusively by the servants and the postman, down to a gate which led out
      into the high road to Perth by one of the farms on the estate, the one
      known as the Bervie.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was about to pass through the small swing gate, she heard a voice
      which she recognized exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Ranscomb! I have to apologize!&rdquo; And from the dark shadow a rather
      tall man emerged and barred her path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you will think this all very mysterious,&rdquo; he went on, laughing
      lightly. &ldquo;But I do hope I have not inconvenienced you. If so, pray accept
      my deepest apologies. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; the girl replied, though somewhat taken aback by the
      suddenness of the encounter. The man spoke slowly and with evident
      refinement. His voice was the same she had heard at Nice on that memorable
      night of gaiety. She recognized it instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood before her, his countenance became revealed in the moonlight,
      and she saw a well-moulded, strongly-marked face, with a pair of dark,
      penetrating eyes, set a little too close perhaps, but denoting strong will
      and keen intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Look at me well, Miss Ranscomb. I am the white
      cavalier whom you last saw disguised by a black velvet mask. Look at me
      again, because perhaps you may wish to recognize me later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are still Mr. X&mdash;eh?&rdquo; asked the girl, who had halted, and
      was gazing upon his rather striking face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still the same,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;Or you may call me Brown, Jones, or
      Robinson&mdash;or any of the other saints&rsquo; names if you prefer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been very kind to me. Surely I may know your real name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Ranscomb. For certain very important reasons I do not wish to
      disclose it. Pardon me&mdash;will you not? I ask that favour of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will you not satisfy my curiosity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At my personal risk? No. I do not think you would wish me to do that&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
       he asked in a tone of mild reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry I could not approach you openly. In London I found out
      that you were up here, so I thought it best to see you in secret. You know
      why I have come to you, Miss Ranscomb&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On behalf of Mr. Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He is still in hiding. It has been impossible&mdash;through force of
      circumstances&mdash;for him to send you further messages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he? I want to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have patience, Miss Ranscomb, and I will arrange a meeting between you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do the police still search for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of an unfortunate fact. The lady, Mademoiselle Ferad, is now
      confined to a private asylum at Cannes, but all the time she raves
      furiously about Monsieur Henfrey. Hence the French police are convinced
      that he shot her&mdash;and they are determined upon his arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think he is guilty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he is not. Yet by force of adverse circumstances, he is compelled
      to conceal himself until such time that we can prove his innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! But shall we ever be in a position to prove that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. We must have patience&mdash;and still more patience,&rdquo; urged
      the mysterious man as he stood in the full light of the brilliant moon. &ldquo;I
      have here a letter for you which Mr. Henfrey wrote a week ago. It only
      came into my hands yesterday.&rdquo; And he gave her an envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me something about this woman, Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo. Who is
      she?&rdquo; asked Dorise excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;she is a person who was notorious at the Rooms, as you
      yourself know. You have seen her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tell me, why do you take such an interest in Hugh?&rdquo; inquired the
      girl, not without a note of suspicion in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For reasons best known to myself, Miss Ranscomb. Reasons which are
      personal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly a satisfactory reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I can give few satisfactory replies until we succeed in
      ascertaining the truth of what occurred at the Villa Amette,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      must urge you, Miss Ranscomb, to remain patient, and&mdash;and not to lose
      faith in the man who is wrongfully accused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when can I see him?&rdquo; asked Dorise eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon. But you must be discreet&mdash;and you must ask no questions. Just
      place yourself in my hands&mdash;that is, if you can trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, even though I am ignorant of your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is best that you remain in ignorance,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;Otherwise
      perhaps you would hesitate to trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the tall, good-looking man only laughed, and then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name really doesn&rsquo;t matter at present. Later, Miss Ranscomb, you will
      no doubt know it. I am only acting in the interests of Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she looked at him. His face was smiling, and yet was sphinx-like in
      the moonlight. His voice was certainly that of the white cavalier which
      she recollected so well, but his personality, so strongly marked, was a
      little overbearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you mistrust me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;If I were in your place I certainly
      should do so. A thousand pities it is that I cannot tell you who I am. But&mdash;well&mdash;I
      tell you in confidence that I dare not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare not! Of what are you afraid?&rdquo; inquired Dorise. The man she had met
      under such romantic circumstances interested her keenly. He was Hugh&rsquo;s
      go-between. Poor Hugh! She knew he was suffering severely in his
      loneliness, and his incapability to clear himself of the terrible stigma
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of several things,&rdquo; replied the white cavalier. &ldquo;The greatest
      fear I have is that you may not believe in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe in you,&rdquo; declared the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; he replied enthusiastically. &ldquo;Then let us get to business&mdash;pardon
      me for putting it so. But I am, after all, a business man. I am interested
      in a lot of different businesses, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Ranscomb. That is another point upon which I regret that I
      cannot satisfy your pardonable curiosity. Please allow your mind to rest
      upon the one main point&mdash;that I am acting in the interests of the man
      with&mdash;the man who is, I believe, your greatest and most intimate
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood that when we met in Nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Now I understand that your mother, Lady Ranscomb, is much against
      your marriage with Hugh Henfrey. She has other views.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! Who told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ascertained it in the course of my inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorise paused, and then looking the man of mystery straight in the face,
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you really know about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he laughed lightly. &ldquo;A good deal. Now tell me when could you be
      free to get away from your mother for a whole day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know. Just tell me the date. When are you returning to London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Saturday week. I could get away&mdash;say&mdash;on Tuesday week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. You would have to leave London by an early train in the
      morning&mdash;if I fail to send a car for you, which I hope to do. And be
      back again late at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Because I have a reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you will take me to meet Hugh&mdash;eh? Ah! How good you are!&rdquo;
       cried the girl in deep emotion. &ldquo;I shall never be able to thank you
      sufficiently for all you are doing. I&mdash;I have been longing all these
      weeks to see him again&mdash;to hear his explanation why he went to the
      woman&rsquo;s house at that hour&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will tell you everything, no doubt,&rdquo; said her mysterious visitor. &ldquo;He
      will tell you everything except one fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One fact he will not tell you. But you will know it later. Hugh Henfrey
      is a fine manly fellow, Miss Ranscomb. That is why I have done my level
      best in his interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You are, after all, a stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. But you will know the truth some day. Meanwhile, leave matters as
      they are. Do not prejudge him, even if the police are convinced of his
      guilt. Could you be at King&rsquo;s Cross station at ten o&rsquo;clock on the morning
      of Tuesday week? If so, I will meet you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But where are we going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present I have no idea. When one is escaping from the police one&rsquo;s
      movements have to be ruled by circumstances from hour to hour. I will do
      my best on that day to arrange a meeting between you,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him very sincerely. He was still a mystery, but his face and
      his whole bearing attracted her. He was her friend. She recollected his
      words amid that gay revelry at Nice&mdash;words of encouragement and
      sympathy. And he had travelled there, far north into Perthshire, in order
      to carry the letter which she had thrust into her pocket, yet still
      holding it in her clenched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish you would tell me the motive of your extreme kindness towards
      us both,&rdquo; Dorise urged. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out at all. I am bewildered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;so am I, Miss Ranscomb,&rdquo; replied the tall, elegant man who
      spoke with such refinement, and was so shrewd and alert. &ldquo;There are
      certain facts&mdash;facts of which I have no knowledge. The affair at the
      Villa Amette is still, to me, a most profound mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did Hugh go there at all? That is what I fail to understand,&rdquo; she
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wonder any longer. He had, I know, an urgent and distinct motive to
      call that night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the woman! I hear she is a notorious adventuress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the adventuress, Miss Ranscomb, often has, deep in her soul, the
      heart of a pure woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One must never judge by appearance or
      gossip. What people may think is the curse of many of our lives. I hope
      you do not misjudge Mr. Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not. But I am anxious to hear his explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall&mdash;and before long, too,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But I want you, if
      you will, to answer a question. I do not put it from mere idle curiosity,
      but it very closely concerns you both. Have you ever heard him speak of a
      girl named Louise Lambert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise Lambert? Why, yes! He introduced her to me once. She is, I
      understand, the adopted daughter of a man named Benton, an intimate friend
      of old Mr. Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he ever told you anything concerning her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing much. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never told you the conditions of his father&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never&mdash;except that he has been left very poorly off, though his
      father died in affluent circumstances. What are the conditions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mysterious stranger paused for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, of late, formed an acquaintance of a certain Mrs. Bond, a
      widow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met her recently in South Kensington, at the house of a friend of my
      mother, Mrs. Binyon. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many times have you met her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two&mdash;or I think three. She came to tea with us the day before we
      came up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Your mother seems rather prone to make easy acquaintanceships&mdash;eh?
      The Hardcastles were distinctly undesirable, were they not?&mdash;and the
      Jameses also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you know about them?&rdquo; asked the girl, much surprised, as
      they were two families who had been discovered to be not what they
      represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I happen to be aware of your mother&rsquo;s charm&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know quite a bit about us,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;How is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have made it my business to know, Miss Ranscomb,&rdquo; he replied.
      &ldquo;Further, I would urge upon you to have nothing to do with Mrs. Bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? We found her most pleasant. She is the widow of a wealthy man
      who died abroad about two years ago, and she lives somewhere down in
      Surrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about that,&rdquo; he answered in a curious tone. &ldquo;But I repeat my
      warning that Mrs. Bond is by no means a desirable acquaintance. I tell you
      so for your own benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly he was angry that the woman should have so cleverly made the
      acquaintance of the girl. It showed him plainly that Benton and she were
      working on a set and desperate plan, while the girl before him was
      entirely ignorant of the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Miss Ranscomb,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I want you to please make me a promise&mdash;namely,
      that you will say nothing to a single soul of what I have said this
      evening&mdash;not even to your friend, Mr. Henfrey. I have very strong
      reasons for this. Remember, I am acting in the interests of you both, and
      secrecy is the essence of success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. But you really mystify me. I know you are my friend,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;but why are you doing all this for our benefit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order that Hugh Henfrey may return to your side, and that hand in hand
      you may be able to defeat your enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My enemies! Who are they?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day, very soon, they must reveal themselves. When they do, and you
      find yourself in difficulties, you have only to call upon me, and I will
      further assist you. Advertise in the <i>Times</i> newspaper at any time
      for an appointment with &lsquo;Silverado.&rsquo; Give me seven days, and I will keep
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do tell me your name!&rdquo; she urged, as they moved together from the
      pathway along the road in the direction of Perth. &ldquo;I beg of you to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already begged a favour of you, Miss Ranscomb,&rdquo; he answered in a
      soft, refined voice. &ldquo;I ask you not to press your question. Suffice it
      that I am your sincere friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when shall I see Hugh?&rdquo; she cried, again halting. &ldquo;I cannot bear this
      terrible suspense any longer&mdash;indeed I can&rsquo;t! Can I go to him soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried a voice from the shadow of a bush close beside them as a dark
      alert figure sprang forth into the light. &ldquo;It is needless. I am here,
      dearest!&mdash;<i>at last</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And next second she found herself clasped in her lover&rsquo;s strong embrace,
      while the stranger, utterly taken aback, stood looking on, absolutely
      mystified.

      FIFTEENTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE NAMELESS MAN
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this gentleman, Dorise?&rdquo; asked Hugh, when a moment later the girl
      and her companion had recovered from their surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot introduce you,&rdquo; was her reply. &ldquo;He refuses to give his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tall man laughed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you that my name is X.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh regarded the stranger with distinct suspicion. It was curious that he
      should discover them together, yet he made but little comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were just speaking about you, Mr. Henfrey,&rdquo; the tall man went on. &ldquo;I
      believed that you were still in Belgium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know I was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;well, information concerning your hiding-place reached me,&rdquo; was
      his enigmatical reply. &ldquo;I am, however, glad you have been able to return
      to England in safety. I was about to arrange a meeting between you. But I
      advise you to be most careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know a good deal concerning me,&rdquo; Hugh remarked resentfully,
      looking at the stern, rather handsome face in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the gentleman who sought me out in Nice, and first told me of
      your peril, Hugh. I recognize his voice, and have to thank him for a good
      deal,&rdquo; the girl declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Miss Ranscomb, I require no thanks,&rdquo; the polite stranger assured
      her. &ldquo;If I have been able to render Mr. Henfrey a little service it has
      been a pleasure to me. And now that you are together again I will leave
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who are you?&rdquo; demanded Hugh, filled with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That matters not, now that you are back in England. Only I beseech of you
      to be very careful,&rdquo; said the tall man. Then he added: &ldquo;There are pitfalls
      into which you may very easily fall&mdash;traps set by your enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I thank you sincerely for what you have done for Miss Ranscomb
      during my absence,&rdquo; said the young man, much mystified at finding Dorise
      strolling at that hour with a man of whose name even she was ignorant. &ldquo;I
      know I have enemies, and I shall certainly heed your warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your enemies must not know you are in England. If they do, they will most
      certainly inform the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take care of that,&rdquo; was Hugh&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;I shall be compelled to go
      into hiding again&mdash;but where, I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must certainly continue to lie low for a time,&rdquo; the man urged.
      &ldquo;I know how very dull it must have been for you through all those weeks.
      But even that is better than the scandal of arrest and trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I know of what you are accused, Hugh!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;And I also
      know you are innocent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Henfrey is innocent,&rdquo; said the tall stranger. &ldquo;But there must be no
      publicity, hence his only chance of safety lies in strict concealment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult to conceal oneself in England,&rdquo; replied Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger laughed, as he slowly answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are certain places where no questions are asked&mdash;if you know
      where to look for them. But first, I am very interested to know how you
      got over here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to Ostend, and for twenty pounds induced a Belgian fisherman to
      put me ashore at night near Caister, in Norfolk. I went to London at once,
      only to discover that Miss Ranscomb was at Blairglas&mdash;and here I am.
      But I assure you it was an adventurous crossing, for the weather was
      terrible&mdash;a gale blew nearly the whole time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are here, it is true, Mr. Henfrey. But you mustn&rsquo;t remain here,&rdquo; the
      stranger declared. &ldquo;Though I refuse to give you my name, I will
      nevertheless try to render you further assistance. Go back to London by
      the next train you can get, and then call upon Mrs. Mason, who lives at a
      house called &lsquo;Heathcote,&rsquo; in Abingdon Road, Kensington. She is a friend of
      mine, and I will advise her by telegram that she will have a visitor. Take
      apartments at her house, and remain there in strict seclusion. Will you
      remember the address&mdash;shall I write it down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks very much indeed,&rdquo; Hugh replied. &ldquo;I shall remember it. Mrs. Mason,
      &lsquo;Heathcote,&rsquo; Abingdon Road, Kensington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Get there as soon as ever you can,&rdquo; urged the stranger.
      &ldquo;Recollect that your enemies are still in active search of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh looked his mysterious friend full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said, in a firm, hard voice. &ldquo;Are you known as Il
      Passero?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; answered the stranger. &ldquo;I refuse to satisfy your curiosity as
      to who I may be. I am your friend&mdash;that is all that concerns you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the famous Passero&mdash;The Sparrow&mdash;is my unknown friend,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and I have a suspicion that you and he are identical!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a motive in not disclosing my identity,&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s reply in a
      curious tone. &ldquo;Get to Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s as quickly as you can. Perhaps one day
      soon we may meet again. Till then, I wish both of you the best of luck. <i>Au
      revoir</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, raising his hat, he turned abruptly, and, leaving them, set off up
      the high road which led to Perth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, listen, sir&mdash;one moment!&rdquo; cried Hugh, as he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the stranger heeded not, and a few seconds later his figure
      was lost in the shadow of the high hedgerow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, a few moments later, &ldquo;all this is most amazing. I feel
      certain that he is either the mysterious Sparrow himself, or one of his
      chief accomplices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sparrow? Who is he&mdash;dear?&rdquo; asked Dorise, her hand upon her
      lover&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down somewhere, and I will tell you,&rdquo; he said. Then,
      re-entering the park by the small iron gate, Dorise led him to a fallen
      tree where, as they sat together, he related all he had been told
      concerning the notorious head of a criminal gang known to his
      confederates, and the underworld of Europe generally, as Il Passero, or
      The Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very remarkable!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorise, when he had finished, and she, in
      turn, had told him of the encounter at the White Ball at Nice, and the
      coming and going of the messenger from Malines. &ldquo;I wonder if he really is
      the notorious Sparrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel convinced he is,&rdquo; declared Hugh. &ldquo;He sent me a message in secret
      to Malines a fortnight ago forbidding me to attempt to leave Belgium,
      because he considered the danger too great. He was, no doubt, much
      surprised to-night when he found me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly was quite as surprised as myself,&rdquo; the girl replied, happy
      beyond expression that her lover was once again at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his strong arms he held her in a long, tight embrace, kissing her upon
      the lips in a frenzy of satisfaction&mdash;long, sweet kisses which she
      reciprocated with a whole-heartedness that told him of her devotion.
      There, in the shadow, he whispered to her his love, repeating what he had
      told her in London, and again in Monte Carlo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he put a question to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really believe I am innocent of the charge against me, darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, Hugh,&rdquo; she answered frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Thank you for those words,&rdquo; he said, in a broken voice. &ldquo;I feared
      that you might think because of my flight that I was guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are not. Mother, of course, says all sorts of nasty things&mdash;that
      you must have done something very wrong&mdash;and all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My escape certainly gives colour to the belief that I am in fear of
      arrest. And so I am. Yet I swear that I never attempted to harm the lady
      at the Villa Amette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you go there at all, dear?&rdquo; the girl asked. &ldquo;You surely knew
      the unenviable reputation borne by that woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it quite well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I expected to meet an adventuress&mdash;but,
      on the contrary, I met a real good woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Hugh,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling. You, of course, cannot understand!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I admit
      that I followed her home, and I demanded an interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was determined she should divulge to me a secret of her own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One that concerns my whole future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you tell me what it is?&rdquo; she asked, looking into his face, which
      in the moonlight she saw was much changed, for it was unusually pale and
      haggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;well&mdash;at the present moment I am myself mystified, darling.
      Hence I cannot explain the truth,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Will you trust me if I
      promise to tell you the whole facts as soon as I have learnt them? One day
      I hope I shall know all, yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yet&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor unfortunate lady has lost her reason as the result of the
      attempt upon her life. Therefore, after all, I may never be in a position
      to know the truth which died upon her lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For nearly two hours the pair remained together. Often she was locked in
      her lover&rsquo;s arms, heedless of everything save her unbounded joy at his
      return, and of the fierce, passionate caresses he bestowed upon her.
      Truly, that was a night of supreme delight as they held each other&rsquo;s
      hands, and their lips met time after time in ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inquired about George Sherrard, but she said little. She hesitated to
      tell him of the incident while fishing that morning, but merely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! He was up here for two or three days, but had to go back to London on
      business. And I was very glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, dearest, your mother still presses you to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed the girl. &ldquo;But she will continue to press. She&rsquo;s constantly
      singing his praises until I&rsquo;m utterly sick of hearing of all his good
      qualities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh sighed, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All men who are rich are possessed of good qualities in the estimation of
      the world. The poor and hard-up are the despised. But, after all, Dorise,&rdquo;
       he added, in a changed voice, &ldquo;you have not forgotten what you told me at
      Monte Carlo&mdash;that you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat it, Hugh!&rdquo; declared the girl, deeply in earnest, her hand
      stealing into his. &ldquo;I love only you!&mdash;<i>you</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then again he took her in his arms, and imprinted a fierce, passionate
      kiss upon her ready lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we must part again,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I am compelled to keep away
      from you because no doubt a watch has been set upon you, and upon your
      correspondence. Up to the present, I have been able, by the good grace of
      unknown friends, to slip through the meshes of the net spread for me. But
      how long this will continue, I know not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do be careful, Hugh, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; urged the girl, as they sat side by
      side. The only sound was the rippling of the burn deep down in the glen,
      and the distant barking of a shepherd&rsquo;s dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll get away into the wilds of Kensington&mdash;to Abingdon Road.
      One is safer in a London suburb than in a desert, no doubt. West London is
      a good hiding-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recollect the name. Mason, wasn&rsquo;t it? And she lives at &lsquo;Heathcote.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was it. But do not communicate with me, otherwise my place of
      concealment will most certainly be discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t I see you, Hugh?&rdquo; implored the girl. &ldquo;Must we again be parted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It seems so, according to our mysterious friend, whom I believe most
      firmly to be the notorious thief known by the Italian sobriquet of Il
      Passero&mdash;The Sparrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he is a thief?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I am convinced that your friend is none other than the picturesque
      and romantic criminal whose octopus hand is upon almost every great theft
      in Europe, and whom the police always fail to catch, so elusive and clever
      is he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him further details of their first meeting at Nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. That is one of his methods&mdash;secrecy and generosity are his
      two traits. He and his accomplices rob the wealthy, and assist those
      wrongly accused. It must be he&mdash;or one of his assistants. Otherwise
      he would not know of the secret hiding-place for those after whom a
      hue-and-cry has been raised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He recollected at that moment the girl who had been his fellow-guest in
      Genoa&mdash;the dainty mademoiselle who evidently had some secret
      knowledge of his father&rsquo;s death, and yet refused to divulge a single word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since that memorable night at the Villa Amette, he had existed in a
      mist of suspicion and uncertainty. Yet, after all, he cared little for
      anything so long as Dorise still believed in his innocence, and she still
      loved him. His one great object was to clear up the mystery of his
      father&rsquo;s tragic end, and thus defeat the clever plot of those whose
      intention it, apparently, was to marry him to Louise Lambert.
    </p>
    <p>
      On every hand there was mystification. The one woman&mdash;notorious as
      she was&mdash;who knew the truth had been rendered mentally incompetent by
      an assassin&rsquo;s bullet, while he, himself, was accused of the crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey would have long ago confessed to Dorise the whole facts
      concerning his father&rsquo;s death, but his delicacy prevented him. He honoured
      his dead father, and was averse to telling the girl he loved that he had
      been found in a curious state in a West End street late at night. He was
      loyal to his poor father&rsquo;s memory, and, until he knew the actual truth, he
      did not intend that Dorise should be in a position to misconstrue the
      facts, or to misjudge.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the face of it, his father&rsquo;s death was exceedingly suspicious. He had
      left his home in the country and gone to town upon pretence. Why? That a
      woman was connected with his journey was now apparent. Hugh had
      ascertained certain facts which he had resolved to withhold from
      everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should the notorious Sparrow, the King of the Underworld, interest
      himself so actively on his behalf as to travel up there to Perthshire,
      after making those secret, but elaborate, arrangements for safety? The
      whole affair was a mystery, complete and insoluble.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early morning, after they had rambled for several hours in the
      moonlight, when Hugh bade his well-beloved farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had returned through the park and were at a gate quite close to the
      castle when they halted. It had crossed Hugh&rsquo;s mind that they might be
      seen by one of the keepers, and he had mentioned this to Dorise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matter?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;They do not know you, and probably will not
      recognize me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So after promising Hugh to remain discreet, she told him they were
      returning to London in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;We must meet again very soon, darling. I
      daresay I may venture out at night, therefore why not let us make an
      appointment&mdash;say, for Tuesday week. Where shall we meet? At midnight
      at the first seat on the right on entering the part at the Marble Arch?
      You remember, we met there once before&mdash;about a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I know the spot,&rdquo; the girl replied. &ldquo;I remember what a cold, wet
      night it was, too!&rdquo; and she laughed at the recollection. &ldquo;Very well. I
      will contrive to be there. That night we are due at a dance at the
      Gordons&rsquo; in Grosvenor Gardens. But I&rsquo;ll manage to be there somehow&mdash;if
      only for five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he exclaimed, again kissing her fondly. &ldquo;Now I must make all speed
      to Kensington and there go once more into hiding. When&mdash;oh, when will
      this wearying life be over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a friend, as I have, in the mysterious white cavalier,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I wonder who he really is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sparrow&mdash;without a doubt&mdash;the famous &lsquo;Il Passero&rsquo; for whom
      the police of Europe are ever searching, the man who at one moment lives
      in affluence and the highest respectability in a house somewhere near
      Piccadilly, and at another is tearing over the French, Spanish, or Italian
      roads in his powerful car directing all sorts of crooked business. It&rsquo;s a
      strange world in which I find myself, Dorise, I assure you! Good-bye,
      darling&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo; and he took her in a final embrace. &ldquo;Good-bye&mdash;till
      Tuesday week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then stepping on to the grass, where his feet fell noiselessly, he
      disappeared in the dark shadow of the great avenue of beeches.

      SIXTEENTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ESCROCS OF LONDON
    </h3>
    <p>
      For ten weary days Hugh Henfrey had lived in the close, frowsy-smelling
      house in Abingdon Road, Kensington, a small, old-fashioned place, once a
      residence of well-to-do persons, but now sadly out of repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its occupier was a worthy, and somewhat wizened, widow named Mason, who
      was supposed to be the relict of an army surgeon who had been killed at
      the Battle of the Marne. She was about sixty, and suffered badly from
      asthma. Her house was too large for one maid, a stout, matronly person
      called Emily, hence the place was not kept as clean as it ought to have
      been, and the cuisine left much to be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, it appeared to be a safe harbour of refuge for certain strange
      persons who came there, men who looked more or less decent members of
      society, but whose talk and whose slang was certainly that of crooks. That
      house in the back street of old-world Kensington, a place built before
      Victoria ascended the throne, was undoubtedly on a par with the flat of
      the Reveccas in Genoa, and the thieves&rsquo; sanctuary in the shadow of the
      cathedral at Malines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adversity brings with it queer company, and Hugh had found himself among a
      mixed society of men who had been gentlemen and had taken up the criminal
      life as an up-to-date profession. They all spoke of The Sparrow with awe;
      and they all wondered what his next great coup would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh became more than ever satisfied that Il Passero was one of the
      greatest and most astute criminals who have graced the annals of our time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone sang his praise. The queer visitors who lodged there for a day, a
      couple of days, or more; the guests who came suddenly, and who disappeared
      just as quickly, were one and all loud in their admiration of Il Passero,
      though Hugh could discover nobody who had actually seen the arch-thief in
      the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Tuesday night Hugh had had a frugal and badly-cooked meal with
      three mysterious men who had arrived as Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s guests during the
      day. After supper the widow rose and left the room, whereupon the trio,
      all well-dressed men-about-town, began to chatter openly about a little
      &ldquo;deal&rdquo; in diamonds in which they had been interested. The &ldquo;deal&rdquo; in
      question had been reported in the newspapers on the previous morning,
      namely, how a Dutch diamond dealer&rsquo;s office in Hatton Garden had been
      broken into, the safe cut open by the most scientific means, and a very
      valuable parcel of stones extracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry Austen has gone down to Surrey to stay with Molly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Molly? Why, I thought she was in Paris!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was&mdash;but she went to America for a trip and she finds it more
      pleasant to live down in Surrey just now,&rdquo; replied the other with a grin.
      &ldquo;She has Charlie&rsquo;s girl living with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; grunted the third man. &ldquo;Not quite the sort of companion Charlie
      might choose for his daughter&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh took but little notice of the conversation. It was drawing near the
      time when he would go forth to meet Dorise at their trysting place. In
      anxiety he went into the adjoining room, and there smoked alone until just
      past eleven o&rsquo;clock, when he put on his hat and went forth into the dark,
      deserted street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite High Street Kensington Station he jumped upon a bus, and at five
      minutes to midnight alighted at the Marble Arch. On entering the park he
      quickly found the seat he had indicated as their meeting place, and sat
      down to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The home-going theatre traffic behind him in the Bayswater Road had nearly
      ceased as the church clocks chimed the midnight hour. In the semi-darkness
      of the park dark figures were moving, lovers with midnight trysts like his
      own. In the long, well-lit road behind him motors full of gaily-dressed
      women flashed homeward from suppers or theatres, while from the open
      windows of a ballroom in a great mansion, the house of an iron magnate,
      came the distant strains of waltz music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time dragged along. He strained his eyes down the dark pathway, but could
      see no approaching figure. Had she at the last moment been prevented from
      coming? He knew how difficult it was for her to slip away at night, for
      Lady Ranscomb was always so full of engagements, and Dorise was compelled
      to go everywhere with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he saw a female figure in the distance, as she turned into the
      park from the Marble Arch, and springing to his feet, he went forward to
      meet her. At first he was not certain that it was Dorise, but as he
      approached nearer he recognized her gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few seconds later he confronted her and grasped her warmly by the hand.
      The black cloak she was wearing revealed a handsome jade-coloured evening
      gown, while her shoes were not those one would wear for promenading in the
      park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome at last, darling!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I was wondering if you could get
      away, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a little difficulty,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at a dance at the Gordons&rsquo; 
      in Grosvenor Gardens, but I managed to slip out, find a taxi, and run
      along here. I fear I can&rsquo;t stay long, or they will miss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even five minutes with you is bliss to me, darling,&rdquo; he said, grasping
      her ungloved hand and raising it to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Hugh. If you could only return to us, instead of living under this
      awful cloud of suspicion!&rdquo; the girl cried. &ldquo;Every day, and every night, I
      think of you, dear, and wonder how you are dragging out your days in
      obscurity down in Kensington. Twice this week I drove along the Earl&rsquo;s
      Court Road, quite close to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! life is a bit dull, certainly,&rdquo; he replied cheerfully. &ldquo;But I have
      papers and books&mdash;and I can look out of the window on to the houses
      opposite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you go out for a ramble at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Last night I set out at one o&rsquo;clock and walked up
      to Hampstead Heath, as far as Jack Straw&rsquo;s Castle and back. The night was
      perfect. Really, Londoners who sleep heavily all night lose the best part
      of their lives. London is only beautiful in the night hours and at early
      dawn. I often watch the sun rise from the Thames Embankment. I have a
      favourite seat&mdash;just beyond Scotland Yard. I&rsquo;ve become quite a
      night-bird these days. I sleep when the sun shines, and with a sandwich
      box and a flask I go long tramps at night, just as others do who, like
      myself, are concealing their identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when will all this end?&rdquo; queried the girl, as together they strolled
      in the direction of Bayswater, passing many whispering couples sitting on
      seats. London lovers enjoy the park at all hours of the twenty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will only end when I am able to discover the truth,&rdquo; he said vaguely.
      &ldquo;Meanwhile I am not disheartened, darling, because&mdash;because I know
      that you believe in me&mdash;that you still trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man whom I saw in Nice dressed as a cavalier, and who again came to
      me in Scotland, is a mystery,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you really believe he is the
      person you suspect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. I still believe he is the notorious and defiant criminal &lsquo;Il
      Passero&rsquo;&mdash;the most daring and ingenious thief of the present
      century.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is evidently your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That is the great mystery of it all. I cannot discern his motive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a sinister one, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I do not believe so. I have heard of The Sparrow&rsquo;s fame from the lips
      of many criminals, but none has uttered a single word against him. He is,
      I hear, fierce, bitter, and relentless towards those who are his enemies.
      To his friends, however, he is staunchly loyal. That is what is said of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Hugh, I wish you would be more frank with me,&rdquo; the girl said. &ldquo;There
      are several things you are hiding from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit it, darling,&rdquo; he blurted forth, holding her hand in the darkness
      as they walked. The ecstasy and the bliss of that moment held him almost
      without words. She was as life to him. He pursued that soul-deadening
      evasion, and lived that grey, sordid life among men and women escaping
      from justice solely for her sake. If he married Louise Lambert and then
      cast off the matrimonial shackles he would recover his patrimony and be
      well-off.
    </p>
    <p>
      To many men the temptation would have proved too great. The inheritance of
      his father&rsquo;s fortune was so very easy. Louise was a pretty girl, well
      educated, bright, vivacious, and thoroughly up to date. Yet somehow, he
      always mistrusted Benton, though his father, perhaps blinded in his years,
      had reckoned him his best and most sincere friend. There are many
      unscrupulous men who pose as dear, devoted friends of those who they know
      are doomed by disease to die&mdash;men who hope to be left executors with
      attaching emoluments, and men who have some deep game to play either by
      swindling the orphans, or by advancing one of their own kith and kin in
      the social scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mr. Henfrey, a genuine country landowner of the good old school, a man
      who lived in tweeds and leggings, and who rode regularly to hounds and
      enjoyed his days across the stubble, was one of the unsuspicious. Charles
      Benton he had first met long ago in the Hotel de Russie in Rome while he
      was wintering there. Benton was merry, and, apparently, a gentleman. He
      talked of his days at Harrow, and afterwards at Cambridge, of being sent
      down because of a big &ldquo;rag&rdquo; in the Gladstonian days, and of his life since
      as a fairly well-off bachelor with rooms in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus a close intimacy had sprung up between them, and Hugh had naturally
      regarded his father&rsquo;s friend with entire confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit that you are not telling me the whole truth, Hugh,&rdquo; remarked
      the girl after a long pause. &ldquo;It is hardly fair of you, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! darling, you do not know my position,&rdquo; he hastened to explain as he
      gripped her little hand more tightly in his own. &ldquo;I only wish I could
      learn the truth myself so as to make complete explanation. But at present
      all is doubt and uncertainty. Won&rsquo;t you trust me, Dorise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust you!&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;Why, of course I will! You surely know that,
      Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man was again silent for some moments. Then he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, after all, I can see no ray of hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope of our marriage, Dorise,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;How can I, without
      money, ever hope to make you my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will have your father&rsquo;s estate in due course, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
      asked quite innocently. &ldquo;You always plead poverty. You are so like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Dorise, I am really poor. You don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;<i>you can&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You may have debts. Every man has them&mdash;tailor&rsquo;s
      bills, restaurant bills, betting debts, jewellery debts. Oh! I know. I&rsquo;ve
      heard all about these things from another. Well, if you have them, you&rsquo;ll
      be able to settle them out of your father&rsquo;s estate all in due course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he has left me nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed the handsome girl at his side. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he said very slowly. &ldquo;At present I have nothing&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all. That is why at Monte Carlo I suggested that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not conclude the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember. You said that I had better marry George Sherrard&mdash;that
      thick-lipped ass. You said that because you are hard-up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I am hard-up. Very hard-up. At present I am existing in an obscure
      lodging practically upon the charity of a man upon whom, so far as I can
      ascertain, I have no claim whatsoever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The notorious thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh nodded, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fact in itself mystifies me. I can see no motive. I am entirely
      innocent of the crime attributed to me, and if Mademoiselle were in her
      right mind she would instantly clear me of this terrible charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you go to her home that night, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I have already told you, I went to demand a reply to a single question
      I put to her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But please do no let us discuss the affair
      further. The whole circumstances are painful to me&mdash;more painful than
      you can possibly imagine. One day&mdash;and I hope it will be soon&mdash;you
      will fully realize what all this has cost me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Hugh,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know, dear&mdash;and I do trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They halted, and he bent and impressed upon her lips a fierce caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      So entirely absorbed in each other were the pair that they failed to
      notice the slim figure of a man who had followed the girl at some
      distance. Indeed, the individual in question had been lurking outside the
      house in Grosvenor Gardens, and had watched Dorise leave. At the end of
      the street a taxi was drawn up at the kerb awaiting him. Dorise had hailed
      the man, but his reply was a surly &ldquo;Engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, walking about a couple of hundred yards, she had found another, and
      entering it, had driven to the Marble Arch. But the first taxi had
      followed the second one, and in it was the well-set-up man who was
      silently watching her in the park as she walked with her lover towards the
      Victoria Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I say to you in reply to your words of hope, darling?&rdquo; exclaimed
      Hugh as he walked beside her. &ldquo;I know full well how much all this must
      puzzle you. Have you seen Brock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes. I saw him two days ago. He called upon mother and had tea. I
      managed to get five minutes alone with him, and I asked if he had heard
      from you. He replied that he had not. He&rsquo;s much worried about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he, dear old chap? I only wish I dared write to him, and give him my
      address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him that you were back in London. But I did not give him your
      address. You told me to disclose nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, Dorise,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If, as I hope one day to do, I can ever
      clear myself and combat my secret enemies, then there will be revealed to
      you a state of things of which you little dream. To-day I confess I am
      under a cloud. In the to-morrow I hope and pray that I may be able to
      expose the guilty and throw a new light upon those who have conspired to
      secure my downfall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had halted in the dark path, and again their lips met in fond caress.
      Behind them was the silent watcher, the tall man who had followed Dorise
      when she had made her secret exit from the house wherein the gay dance was
      till in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      An empty seat was near, and with one accord the lovers sank upon it, Hugh
      still holding the girl&rsquo;s soft hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must really go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mother will miss me, no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And George Sherrard, too?&rdquo; asked her companion bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then he is with you to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Unfortunately, he is. Ah! Hugh! How I hate his exquisite and
      superior manners. But he is such a close friend of mother&rsquo;s that I can
      never escape him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he still pesters you with his attentions, of course,&rdquo; remarked Hugh
      in a hard voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, he is always pretending to be in love with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love!&rdquo; echoed Hugh. &ldquo;Can such a man ever love a woman? Never, Dorise. He
      does not love you as I love you&mdash;with my whole heart and my whole
      soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course the fellow cannot,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But, for mother&rsquo;s sake, I
      have to suffer his presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least you are frank, darling,&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only tell you the truth, dear. Mother thinks she can induce me to marry
      him because he is so rich, but I repeat that I have no intention whatever
      of doing so. I love you, Hugh&mdash;and only you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he took her in his strong arms and pressed her to him, still being
      watched by the mysterious individual who had followed Dorise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my darling, these are, indeed, moments of supreme happiness,&rdquo; Hugh
      exclaimed as he held her tightly in his arms. &ldquo;I wonder when we dare meet
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon, dear&mdash;very soon, I hope. Let us make another appointment,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;On Friday week mother is going to spend the night with Mrs. Deane
      down at Ascot. I shall make excuse to stay at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. Friday week at the same place and time,&rdquo; he said cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go now,&rdquo; she said regretfully. &ldquo;I only wish I could stay
      longer, but I must get back at once. If mother misses me she&rsquo;ll have a
      fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he walked with her out of the Victoria Gate into the Bayswater Road and
      put her into an empty taxi which was passing back to Oxford Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when he had pressed her hand and wished her adieu, he continued,
      towards Notting Hill Gate, and thence returned to Kensington.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though he was ignorant of the fact, the rather lank figure which had
      been waiting outside the house in Grosvenor Gardens now followed him
      almost as noiselessly as a shadow. Never once did the watcher lose sight
      of him until he saw him enter the house in Abingdon Road with his
      latchkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when the door had closed, the mysterious watcher passed by and
      scrutinized the number, after which he hastened back to Kensington High
      Street, where he found a belated taxi in which he drove away.

    <h2>
      SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ON THE SURREY HILLS
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the following morning, about twelve o&rsquo;clock, Emily, Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s stout
      maid-of-all-work, showed a tall, well-dressed man into Hugh&rsquo;s frowsy
      little sitting-room where he sat reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet when he recognized his visitor to be Charles Benton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well my boy!&rdquo; cried his visitor cheerily. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve found you at last! We
      all thought you were on the Continent, lying low somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have been,&rdquo; replied the young man faintly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of that
      affair at Monte Carlo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. And you are suspected&mdash;wanted by the police? That&rsquo;s why
      I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Benton replied. &ldquo;This place isn&rsquo;t safe for you. You must get
      away from it at once,&rdquo; he added, lowering his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because at Scotland Yard they know you are somewhere in Kensington, and
      they&rsquo;re hunting high and low for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Harpur, one of the assistant Commissioners of Police, happened to
      be in the club yesterday, and we chatted. So I pumped him as to the
      suspected person from Monte Carlo, and he declared that you were known to
      be in this district, and your arrest was only a matter of time. So you
      must clear out at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; asked Hugh blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a lady you met once or twice with me, Mrs. Bond. She will
      be delighted to put you up for a few weeks. She has a charming house down
      in Surrey&mdash;a place called Shapley Manor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might learn the truth and give me away,&rdquo; remarked Hugh dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t. Recollect, Hugh, that I was your father&rsquo;s friend, and am
      yours. What advice I give you is for your own good. You can&rsquo;t stay here&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name of The Sparrow was upon Hugh&rsquo;s lips, and he was about to tell
      Benton of that mysterious person&rsquo;s efforts on his behalf, but, on
      reflection, he saw that he had no right to expose The Sparrow&rsquo;s existence
      to others. The very house in which they were was one of the bolt-holes of
      the wonderfully organized gang of crooks which Il Passero controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know that I was here?&rdquo; asked Hugh suddenly in curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I&rsquo;m not at liberty to say. It was not a friend of yours, but rather
      an enemy who told me&mdash;hence I tell you that you run the gravest risk
      in remaining here a moment longer. As soon as I heard you were here, I
      telephoned to Mrs. Bond, and she has very generously asked us both to stay
      with her,&rdquo; Benton went on. &ldquo;If you agree, I&rsquo;ll get a car now, without
      delay, and we&rsquo;ll run down into Surrey together,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh glanced at the tall, well-dressed man of whom his father had thought
      so highly. Charles Benton, in spite of his hair tuning grey, was a
      handsome man, and moved in a very good circle of society. Nobody knew his
      source of income, and nobody cared. In these days clothes make the
      gentleman, and a knighthood a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many others, old Mr. Henfrey had been sadly deceived by Charles
      Benton, and had taken him into his family as a friend. Other men had done
      the same. His geniality, his handsome, open face, and his plausible
      manner, proved the open sesame to many doors of the wealthy, and the
      latter were robbed in various ways, yet never dreaming that Benton was the
      instigator of it all. He never committed a theft himself. He gave the
      information&mdash;and others did the dirty work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You recollect Mrs. Bond,&rdquo; said Benton. &ldquo;But I believe Maxwell, her first
      husband, was alive then, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a faint recollection of meeting a Mrs. Maxwell in Paris&mdash;at
      lunch at the Pre Catalan&mdash;was it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course. About six years ago. That&rsquo;s quite right!&rdquo; laughed Benton.
      &ldquo;Well, Maxwell died and she married again&mdash;a Colonel Bond. He was
      killed in Mesopotamia, and now she&rsquo;s living up on the Hog&rsquo;s Back, beyond
      Guildford, on the road to Farnham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh again reflected. He had come to Abingdon Road at the suggestion of
      the mysterious White Cavalier. Ought he to leave the place without first
      consulting him? Yet he had no knowledge of the whereabouts of the man of
      mystery whom he firmly believed was none other than the elusive Sparrow.
      Besides, was not Benton, his father&rsquo;s closest friend, warning him of his
      peril?
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter thought decided him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s awfully good of Mrs. Bond whom I know so slightly to invite
      me to stay with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my dear boy. She&rsquo;s a very old friend of mine. I once did her a
      rather good turn when Maxwell was alive, and she&rsquo;s never forgotten it.
      She&rsquo;s one of the best women in the world, I assure you,&rdquo; Benton declared.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run along to a garage I know in Knightsbridge and get a car to take
      us down to Shapley. It&rsquo;s right out in the country, and as long as you keep
      clear of the town of Guildford&mdash;where the police are unusually wary
      under one of the shrewdest chief constables in England&mdash;then you
      needn&rsquo;t have much fear. Pack up your traps, Hugh, and I&rsquo;ll call for you at
      the end of the road in half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But I&rsquo;ll want a dress suit and lots of other things if I&rsquo;m going to
      stay at a country house,&rdquo; the young man demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot! You can get all you want in Aldershot, Farnham or Portsmouth. Come
      just as you are. Mrs. Bond will make all allowances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And probably have her suspicions aroused at the same time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t. This is a sudden trip into the country. I told her you had
      been taken unwell&mdash;a nervous breakdown&mdash;and that the doctor had
      ordered you complete rest at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had stayed in Monte Carlo and faced the charge against me,&rdquo;
       declared Hugh fervently. &ldquo;Being hunted from pillar to post like this is so
      absolutely nerve-racking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you go to that woman&rsquo;s house, Hugh?&rdquo; Benton asked. &ldquo;What business
      had you that led you to call at that hour upon such a notorious person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh remained silent. He saw that to tell Benton the truth would be to
      reopen the whole question of the will and of Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he merely shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me what really happened at the Villa Amette, Hugh?&rdquo; asked
      the elder man persuasively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Brock, but he apparently knows
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he does not. I was alone,&rdquo; was Hugh&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;The least said
      about that night of horror the better, Benton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So his father&rsquo;s friend left the house, while Hugh sought Mrs. Mason,
      settled his bill with her, packed his meagre wardrobe into a suit-case,
      and half an hour later entered the heavy old limousine which he found at
      the end of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the main Portsmouth road, by way of Kingston, Cobham and Ripley,
      until in the cold grey afternoon they descended the steep hill through
      Guildford High Street, and crossing the bridge, instead of continuing
      along the road to Portsmouth, bore to the right, past the station, and up
      the steep wide road over that long hill, the Hog&rsquo;s Back, whence a great
      misty panorama was spread out on either side of the long, high-up ridge
      which in the sunshine gives such a wonderful view to motorists on their
      way out of London southward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the car turned into the gravelled drive, and Hugh found himself
      at Shapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the chintz-hung, old-world morning-room, lit by the last rays of the
      declining sun, for the sky had suddenly cleared, Mrs. Bond entered,
      loud-voiced and merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Henfrey! I&rsquo;m so awfully pleased to see you. Charles telephoned
      to me that you were a bit out of sorts. So you must stay with me for a
      little while&mdash;both of you. It&rsquo;s very healthy up here on the Surrey
      hills, and you&rsquo;ll soon be quite right again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, Mrs. Bond, it is most hospitable of you,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;London in
      these after the war days is quite impossible. I always long for the
      country. Certainly your house is delightful,&rdquo; he added, looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the nicest houses in the whole county of Surrey, my boy,&rdquo;
       Benton declared enthusiastically. &ldquo;Mrs. Bond was awfully lucky in securing
      it. The family are unfortunately ruined, as so many others are by
      excessive taxation and high prices, and she just stepped in at the
      psychological moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I really don&rsquo;t know how to thank you sufficiently, Mrs. Bond,&rdquo; Hugh
      declared. &ldquo;It is really extremely good of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, Mr. Henfrey, we are not strangers,&rdquo; exclaimed the handsome
      woman. &ldquo;Do you recollect when we met in Paris, and afterwards in Biarritz,
      and then that night at the Carlton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recollect perfectly well. We met before the war, when one could really
      enjoy oneself contentedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since then I have been travelling a great deal,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been in Italy, the South of Spain, the Azores, and over to the States. I
      got back only a few months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so after a chat Hugh was shown to his room, a pretty apartment, from
      the diamond-paned windows of which spread out a lovely view across to
      Godalming and Hindhead, with the South Downs in the blue far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you must make yourselves at home, both of you,&rdquo; the handsome woman
      urged as they came down into the drawing-room after a wash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea was served, and over it much chatter about people and places. Mrs.
      Bond was, like her friend Benton, a thorough-going cosmopolitan. Hugh had
      no idea of her real reputation, or of her remarkable adventures. Neither
      had he any idea that Molly Maxwell was wanted by the Paris Surete, just as
      he himself was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a charming place?&rdquo; remarked Benton as, an hour later, they
      strolled on the long terrace smoking cigarettes before dinner. &ldquo;Mrs. Bond
      was indeed fortunate in finding it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; declared Hugh in genuine admiration. Since that memorable
      night in Monte Carlo he had been living in frowsy surroundings, concealed
      in thieves&rsquo; hiding-places, eating coarse food, and hearing the slang of
      the underworld of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been exciting, yet he had been drawn into it against his will&mdash;just
      because he had feared for Dorise&rsquo;s sake, to face the music after that
      mysterious shot had been fired at the Villa Amette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bond was most courteous to her guests, and as Hugh and Benton
      strolled up and down the terrace in the fast growing darkness, the elder
      man remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be quite safe here, you know, Hugh. Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m truly sorry
      that you have landed yourself into this hole, but&mdash;well, for the life
      of me I can&rsquo;t see what led you to seek out that woman, Yvonne Ferad. Why
      ever did you go there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I had reasons&mdash;private reasons of my own,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s vague enough. We all have private reasons for doing silly things,
      and it seems that you did an exceptionally silly thing. I hear that
      Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo, after the doctors operated upon her brain,
      has now become a hopeless idiot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told. It is all so very sad&mdash;so horrible. Though people
      have denounced her as an adventuress, yet I know that at heart she is a
      real good woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she? How do you know?&rdquo; asked Benton quickly, for instantly he was on
      the alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. And that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, Hugh&mdash;tell me in confidence, my boy&mdash;what led you
      to seek her that night. You must have followed her from the Casino and
      have seen her enter the Villa. Then you rang at the door and asked to see
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had my own reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell them to me, Hugh?&rdquo; asked the tall man in a strange, low
      voice. &ldquo;Remember, I am an old friend of your father. And I am still your
      best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh pursued his walk in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I prefer not to discuss the affair. That night is
      one full of painful memories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered Benton shortly. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to tell me, Hugh,
      I quite understand. That&rsquo;s enough. Have another cigarette,&rdquo; and he handed
      the young fellow his heavy gold case.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed. Hugh Henfrey and Charles Benton greatly enjoyed their stay
      at Shapley Manor. With their hostess they motored almost daily to many
      points of interest in the neighbourhood, never, by the way, descending
      into the town of Guildford, where the police were so unusually alert and
      shrewd.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once when alone with Benton, Hugh felt impelled to refer to the
      mysterious death of his father, but it was a very painful subject. The
      last time Hugh had referred to it, about a month before his visit to Monte
      Carlo, Benton had been greatly upset, and had begged the young man not to
      mention the tragic affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constantly, however, Benton, on his part, would put cunning questions to
      him concerning Yvonne Ferad, as to what he knew concerning her, and how he
      had managed to escape over the frontier into Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one night as they sat together in the billiard-room after their final
      game, Benton, removing the cigar from his lips, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I quite forgot to tell you, Mrs. Bond has been awfully good to
      Louise. She took her from Paris with her and they went quite a long tour,
      first to Spain and other places, and then to New York and back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she?&rdquo; exclaimed Hugh in surprise. Only once before had Benton
      mentioned Louise&rsquo;s name, then he had casually remarked that she was on a
      visit to some friends in Yorkshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s making her home with Mrs. Bond for the present. She returns
      here to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, he watched the young man&rsquo;s face. It was sphinx-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s jolly!&rdquo; he replied, with well assumed satisfaction. &ldquo;It seems
      such an age since we last met&mdash;nearly a year before my father&rsquo;s
      death, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his heart he had no great liking for the girl, although she was bright,
      vivacious and extremely good company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next afternoon the pair met in the hall after the car had brought her from
      Guildford station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Hugh!&rdquo; she cried as she grasped his hand. &ldquo;Uncle wrote and told me
      you were here! How jolly, isn&rsquo;t it? Why&mdash;you seem to have grown
      older,&rdquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you younger,&rdquo; he replied, bending over her hand gallantly. &ldquo;I hear
      you&rsquo;ve been all over the world of late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Wasn&rsquo;t it awfully good of Mrs. Bond? I had a ripping time. I enjoyed
      New York ever so much. I find this place a bit dull after Paris though, so
      I&rsquo;m often away with friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he followed her into the big morning-room where Mrs. Bond, alias Molly
      Maxwell, was awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon there had been several callers; a retired admiral and his
      wife, and two county magistrates with their womenfolk, for since her
      residence at Shapley Mrs. Bond had been received in a good many smart
      houses, especially by the <i>nouveau riche</i> who abound in that
      neighbourhood. But the callers had left and they were now alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Louise sat opposite the woman who had taken her under her charge, Hugh
      gazed at her furtively and saw that there was no comparison between her
      and the girl he loved so deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange it was, he thought. If he asked her to be his wife and they
      married, he would at once become a wealthy man and inherit all his
      father&rsquo;s possessions. True, she was very sweet and possessed more than the
      ordinary <i>chic</i> and good taste in dress. Yet he felt that he could
      never fulfil his dead father&rsquo;s curious desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could never marry her&mdash;<i>never</i>!

      EIGHTEENTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MAN WITH THE BLACK GLOVE
    </h3>
    <p>
      On his way out of London, Hugh had made excuse and stopped the car at a
      post office in Putney, whence he sent an express note to Dorise, telling
      her his change of address. He though it wiser not to post it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence it was on the morning following Louise&rsquo;s arrival at Shapley, he
      received a letter from Dorise, enclosing one she had received under cover
      for him. He had told Dorise to address him as &ldquo;Mr. Carlton Symes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on dark-blue paper, such as is usually associated with the law or
      officialdom. Written in a neat, educated hand, it read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MR. HENFREY,&mdash;I hear that you have left Abingdon Road, and am
      greatly interested to know the reason. You will, no doubt, recognize me as
      the friend who sent a car for you at Monte Carlo. Please call at the above
      address at the earliest possible moment. Be careful that you are not
      watched. Say nothing to anybody, wherever you may be. Better call about
      ten-thirty P.M., and ask for me. Have no fear. I am still your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GEORGE PETERS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The address given was 14, Ellerston Street, Mayfair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh knew the street, which turned off Curzon Street, a short
      thoroughfare, but very exclusive. Some smart society folk lived there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who was George Peters? Was it not The Sparrow who had sent him the car
      with the facetious chauffeur to that spot in Monte Carlo? Perhaps the
      writer was the White Cavalier!
    </p>
    <p>
      During the morning Hugh strolled down the hill and through the woods with
      Louise. The latter was dressed in a neat country kit, a tweed suit, a
      suede tam-o&rsquo;-shanter, and carried a stout ash-plant as a walking-stick.
      They were out together until luncheon time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Benton sat with his hostess, and had a long confidential chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Molly,&rdquo; he said, as he smoked lazily, &ldquo;I thought it an excellent
      plan to bring them together, and to let them have an opportunity of really
      knowing each other. It&rsquo;s no doubt true that he&rsquo;s over head and ears in
      love with the Ranscomb girl, but Lady Ranscomb has set her mind on having
      Sherrard as her son-in-law. She&rsquo;s a clever woman, Lady Ranscomb, and of
      course, in her eyes, Hugh is for ever beneath a cloud. That he went to the
      woman&rsquo;s house at night is quite sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I know anything of young men, Charles, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll ever
      induce that boy to marry Louise,&rdquo; remarked the handsome adventuress whom
      nobody suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if he doesn&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll just turn him over to Scotland Yard. We haven&rsquo;t
      any further use for him,&rdquo; said Benton savagely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the money we want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I fear we shall go on wanting it, my dear Charles,&rdquo; declared the
      woman, who was so well versed in the ways of men. &ldquo;Louise likes him. She
      has told me so. But he only tolerates her&mdash;that&rsquo;s all! He&rsquo;s obsessed
      by the mystery of old Henfrey&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if that was the reason he went that night to see Yvonne?&rdquo;
       exclaimed Benton in a changed voice, as the idea suddenly occurred to him.
      &ldquo;I wonder if&mdash;if he suspected something, and went boldly and asked
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I wonder!&rdquo; echoed the woman. &ldquo;But Yvonne would surely tell him
      nothing. It would implicate her far too deeply if she did. Yvonne is a
      very shrewd person. She isn&rsquo;t likely to have told the old man&rsquo;s son very
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right, Molly,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right! I don&rsquo;t
      think we have much to fear on that score. We&rsquo;ve got Hugh with us, and if
      he again turns antagonistic the end is quite easy&mdash;just an anonymous
      line to the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to do that if there is any other way,&rdquo; the woman said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any other way,&rdquo; replied the adventurer. &ldquo;If he won&rsquo;t marry
      Louise, then the money passes out of our reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like The Sparrow taking such a deep interest in his welfare,&rdquo;
       growled the woman beneath her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t like the fact that Yvonne is still alive. If she were dead&mdash;then
      we should have nothing to fear&mdash;nothing!&rdquo; Benton said grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who fired the shot if Hugh didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personally, I think he did. He discovered something&mdash;something we
      don&rsquo;t yet know&mdash;and he went to the Villa Amette and shot her in
      revenge for the old man&rsquo;s death. That&rsquo;s my firm belief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why has The Sparrow taken all these elaborate precautions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s afraid himself of the truth coming out,&rdquo; said Benton. &ldquo;He
      certainly has looked after Hugh very well. I had some trouble to persuade
      the lad to come down here, for he evidently believes that The Sparrow is
      his best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may find him his enemy one day,&rdquo; laughed the woman. And then they rose
      and strolled out into the grounds, across the lawn down to the great pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at half-past seven they sat down to dinner, Hugh suddenly remarked
      that he found it imperative to go to London that evening, and asked Mrs.
      Bond if he might have the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benton looked up at him quickly, but said nothing before Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; Mead shall take you,&rdquo; was the woman&rsquo;s reply, though she was
      greatly surprised at the sudden request. Both she and Benton instantly
      foresaw that his intention was to visit Dorise in secret. For what other
      reason could he wish to run the risk of returning to London?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you wish to start?&rdquo; asked his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! about nine&mdash;if I may,&rdquo; was the young man&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be back to-night?&rdquo; asked the girl who, in a pretty pink dinner
      frock, sat opposite him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But it won&rsquo;t be till late, I expect,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, to-morrow we are going for a run to Bournemouth and back,&rdquo; said
      the girl. &ldquo;Mrs. Bond has kindly arranged it, and I daresay she will come,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bond. The truth was that she
      intended that the young couple should spend the day alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benton was filled with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the meal was over, and the two ladies had left the room, he
      poured out a glass of port and turning to the young fellow, remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a bit dangerous to go to town, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be, but I must take the risk,&rdquo; was the other&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going up for?&rdquo; asked Benton bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see somebody&mdash;important,&rdquo; was his vague answer. And though the
      elder man tried time after time to get something more definite from him,
      he remained silent. Had not his unknown friend urged him to say nothing to
      anybody wherever he might be?
    </p>
    <p>
      So at nine Mead drove up the car to the door, and Hugh, slipping on his
      light overcoat, bade his hostess good-night, thanked her for allowing him
      the use of the limousine, and promised to be back soon after midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Hugh!&rdquo; cried Louise from the other end of the fine old hall.
      And a moment later the car drove away in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the Hog&rsquo;s Back they went, and down into Guildford. Then up the long
      steep High Street, past the ancient, overhanging clock at the Guildhall,
      and out again on the long straight road to Ripley and London.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were beyond Guildford, he knocked at the window, and
      afterwards mounted beside Mead. He hated to be in a car alone, for he
      himself was a good driver and used always to drive his father&rsquo;s old
      &ldquo;&lsquo;bus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the Berkeley Hotel,&rdquo; he said to the man. &ldquo;Drop me there, and
      pick me up outside there at twelve, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man promised to do so, and then they chatted as they continued on
      their way to London. Mead, a Guildfordian, knew every inch of the road.
      Before entering Mrs. Bond&rsquo;s service he had, for a month, driven a lorry
      for a local firm of builders, and went constantly to and from London.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at the corner of St. James&rsquo;s Street at half-past ten. Hugh
      gave Mead five shillings to get his evening meal, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be back here at midnight, Mead. I expect I&rsquo;ll be through my business long
      before that. But it&rsquo;s a clear night, and we shall have a splendid run
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir. Thank you,&rdquo; replied his hostess&rsquo;s chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey, instead of entering the smart Society hotel, turned up the
      street, and, walking quickly, found himself ten minutes later in Ellerston
      Street before a spacious house, upon the pale-green door of which was
      marked in Roman numerals the number fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the light of the street lamp he saw it was an old Georgian town house.
      In the ironwork were two-foot-scrapers, relics of a time long before
      macadam or wood paving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house, high and inartistic, was a relic of the days of the dandies,
      when country squires had their town houses, and before labour found itself
      in London drawing-rooms. Consumed by curiosity, Hugh pressed the electric
      button marked &ldquo;visitors,&rdquo; and a few moments later a smart young footman
      opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. George Peters?&rdquo; inquired Hugh. &ldquo;I have an appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name, sir?&rdquo; the young, narrow-eyed man asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, sir! Mr. Peters is expecting you,&rdquo; he said. And at once he
      conducted him along the narrow hall to a room beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was beautifully appointed. Everywhere was taste and luxury. Even
      in the hall there were portraits by old Spanish masters and many rare
      English sporting prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room into which he was shown was a long apartment furnished in the
      style of the Georgian era. The genuine Adams ceiling, mantelpiece, and
      dead white walls, with the faintly faded carpet of old rose and
      light-blue, were all in keeping. The lights, too, were shaded, and over
      all was an old-world atmosphere of quiet and dignified repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was empty, and Hugh crossed to examine a beautiful little marble
      statuette of a girl bather, with her arms raised and about to dive. It
      was, no doubt, a gem of the art of sculpture, mounted upon a pedestal of
      dark-green marble which revolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole conception was delightful, and the girl&rsquo;s laughing face was most
      perfect in its portraiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden the door reopened, and he was met by a stout, rather wizened
      old gentleman with white bristly hair and closely cropped moustache, a man
      whose ruddy face showed good living, and who moved with the brisk
      alertness of a man twenty years his junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! here you are, Mr. Henfrey!&rdquo; he exclaimed warmly, as he offered his
      visitor his hand. Upon the latter was a well-worn black glove&mdash;evidently
      to hide either some disease or deformity. &ldquo;I was wondering if you received
      my letter safely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Hugh, glancing at the shrewd little man whose gloved right
      hand attracted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; the other said, as he closed the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very anxious to
      have a little chat with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh took the arm-chair which Mr. Peters indicated. Somehow he viewed the
      man with suspicion. His eyes were small and piercing, and his face with
      its broad brow and narrow chin was almost triangular. He was a man of
      considerable personality, without a doubt. His voice was high pitched and
      rather petulant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was surprised to learn that you had left your safe
      asylum in Kensington. Not only was I surprised&mdash;but I confess, I was
      alarmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it that I have to thank you for making those arrangements for my
      escape from Monte Carlo?&rdquo; remarked Hugh, looking him straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No thanks are needed, my dear Mr. Henfrey,&rdquo; replied the elder man. &ldquo;So
      long as you are free, what matters? But I do not wish you to deliberately
      run risks which are so easily avoided. Why did you leave Abingdon Road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was advised to do so by a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by Miss Ranscomb, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by a Mr. Benton, whom I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s eyebrows narrowed for a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benton?&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Charles Benton&mdash;is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. As he was a friend of my late father I naturally trust him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Peters paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, naturally,&rdquo; he said a second later. &ldquo;But where are you living now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh told him that he was the guest of Mrs. Bond of Shapley Manor,
      whereupon Mr. Peters sniffed sharply, and rising, obtained a box of good
      cigars from a cupboard near the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went there at Benton&rsquo;s suggestion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Peters gave a grunt of undisguised dissatisfaction, as he curled
      himself in his chair and examined carefully the young man before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Henfrey,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I am very sorry for you. I happen to
      know something of your present position, and the great difficulty in which
      you are to-day placed by the clever roguery of others. Will you please
      describe to me accurately exactly what occurred on that fateful night at
      the Villa Amette? If I am to assist you further it is necessary for you to
      tell me everything&mdash;remember, <i>everything</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh paused and looked the stranger straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you knew all about it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a little&mdash;not all. I want to know everything. Why did you
      venture there at all? You did not know the lady. It was surely a very
      unusual hour to pay a call?&rdquo; said the little man, his shrewd eyes fixed
      upon his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Peters, the fact is that my father died in very suspicious
      circumstances, and I was led to believe the Mademoiselle was cognizant of
      the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other man frowned slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you went there with the purpose of getting the truth from her?&rdquo; he
      remarked, with a grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh nodded in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. She was about to tell me something when the shot was fired by
      someone on the veranda outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Then the natural surmise would be that you, suspecting that woman of
      causing your father&rsquo;s death, shot her because she refused to tell you
      anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat she was about to disclose the circumstances&mdash;to divulge her
      secret, when she was struck down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no suspicion of anyone? You don&rsquo;t think that her manservant&mdash;I
      forget the fellow&rsquo;s name&mdash;fired the shot? Remember, he was not in the
      room at the time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel confident that he did not. He was far too distressed at the
      terrible affair,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;The outrage must have been committed by
      someone to whom the preservation of the secret of my father&rsquo;s end was of
      most vital importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; replied the man with the black glove. &ldquo;The problem we have to
      solve is who was responsible for your father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;If that shot had not been fired I should have known the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then, that Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo would have told you the
      truth?&rdquo; asked the bristly-haired man with a mysterious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Henfrey, I think I am not of your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think possibly she would have implicated herself if she had told me
      the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. But the chief reason I asked you to call and see me to-night is to
      learn for what reason you have been induced to go on a visit to this Mrs.
      Bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Benton suggested it. He told me that Scotland Yard knew of my
      presence in Kensington, making further residence there dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; And the man with the black glove paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Benton, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no real reason to dislike him. He has always been very friendly
      towards me&mdash;as he was to my late father. The only thing which causes
      me to hold aloof from him as much as I can is the strange clause in my
      father&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange clause?&rdquo; echoed the old man. &ldquo;What clause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, in his will, cut me off every benefit he could unless I
      married Benton&rsquo;s adopted daughter, Louise. If I marry her, then I obtain a
      quarter of a million. I at first thought of disputing the will, but Mr.
      Charman, our family solicitor, says that it is perfectly in order. The
      will was made in Paris two years before his death. He went over there on
      some financial business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Benton with him?&rdquo; asked Mr. Peters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Benton went to New York about two months before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! And how soon after your father&rsquo;s return did he come home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was about three months. He was in America five months
      altogether, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man, still curled in his chair, smoked his cigar in silence.
      Apparently he was thinking deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Benton has induced you to go down to Shapley in order that you may be
      near his adopted daughter, in the hope that you will marry her! In the
      meantime you are deeply in love with Lady Ranscomb&rsquo;s daughter. I know her&mdash;a
      truly charming girl. I congratulate you,&rdquo; he added, as though speaking to
      himself. &ldquo;But the situation is indeed a very complicated one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me it is terrible. I am living under a cloud, and in constant fear of
      arrest. What can be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear nothing much can be done at present,&rdquo; said the old man, shaking
      his head gravely. &ldquo;I quite realize that you are victim of certain enemies
      who intend to get hold of your father&rsquo;s fortune. It is for us to combat
      them&mdash;if we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will continue to help me?&rdquo; asked Hugh eagerly, looking into the
      mysterious face of the old fellow who wore the black glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you my aid,&rdquo; he replied, putting out his gloved hand as pledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Hugh took it, he looked straight into those keen eyes, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have asked me many questions, sir, and I have replied to them all.
      May I ask one of you&mdash;my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the older man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then am I correct in assuming that you are actually the person of whom I
      have heard so much up and down Europe&mdash;the man of whom certain men
      and women speak with admiration, and with bated breath&mdash;the man known
      in certain circles as&mdash;as <i>Il Passero</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The countenance of the little man with the bristly white hair and the
      black glove relaxed into a smile, as, still holding Hugh&rsquo;s hand in
      friendship, he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is true. Some know me as &lsquo;The Sparrow!&rsquo;&rdquo;

      NINETEENTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SPARROW
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey was at last face to face with the most notorious criminal in
      Europe!
    </p>
    <p>
      The black-gloved hand of the wizened, bristly-haired old man was the hand
      that controlled a great organization spread all over Europe&mdash;an
      organization which only knew Il Passero by repute, but had never seen him
      in the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there he was, a discreet, rather petulant old gentleman, who lived at
      ease in an exclusive West End street, and was entirely unsuspected!
    </p>
    <p>
      When &ldquo;Mr. Peters&rdquo; admitted his identity, Hugh drew a long breath. He was
      staggered. He was profuse in his thanks, but &ldquo;The Sparrow&rdquo; merely smiled,
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that I and certain of my friends make war upon Society&mdash;and
      more especially upon those who have profiteered upon those brave fellows
      who laid down their lives for us in the war. Whatever you have heard
      concerning me I hope you will forgive, Mr. Henfrey. At least I am the
      friend of those who are in distress, or who are wrongly judged&mdash;as
      you are to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard many strange things concerning you from those who have never
      met you,&rdquo; Hugh said frankly. &ldquo;But nothing to your detriment. Everyone
      speaks of you, sir, as a gallant sportsman, possessed of an almost uncanny
      cleverness in outwitting the authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; laughed the shrewd old man. &ldquo;By the exercise of a little wit,
      and the possession of a little knowledge of the <i>personnel</i> of the
      police, one can usually outwit them. Curious as you may think it, a very
      high official at Scotland Yard dined with me here only last night. As I am
      known as a student of criminology, and reputed to be the author of a book
      upon that subject, he discussed with me the latest crime problem with
      which he had been called upon to deal&mdash;the mysterious murder of a
      young girl upon the beach on the north-east coast. His frankness rather
      amused me. It was, indeed, a quaint situation,&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But does he not recognize you, or suspect?&rdquo; asked Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he? I have never been through the hands of the police in my
      life. Hence I have never been photographed, nor have my finger prints been
      taken. I merely organize&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your organization is most wonderful, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Peters,&rdquo;
       declared the young man. &ldquo;Since my flight I have had opportunity of
      learning something concerning it. And frankly, I am utterly astounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s face again relaxed into a sphinx-like smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I order, I am obeyed,&rdquo; he said in a curious tone. &ldquo;I ordered your
      rescue from that ugly situation in Monte Carlo. You and Miss Ranscomb no
      doubt believed the tall man who went to the ball at Nice as a cavalier to
      be myself. He did not tell you anything to the contrary, because I only
      reveal my identity to persons whom I can trust, and then only in cases of
      extreme necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I take it, sir, that you trust me, and that my case is one of
      extreme necessity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; was The Sparrow&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;At present I can see no solution of the
      problem. It will be best, perhaps, for you to remain where you are for the
      present,&rdquo; he added. He did not tell the young man of his knowledge of
      Benton and his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am very desirous of seeing Miss Ranscomb,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;Is there any
      way possible by which I can meet her without running too great a risk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow reflected in silence for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day is Wednesday,&rdquo; he remarked slowly at last. &ldquo;Miss Ranscomb is in
      London. That I happen to know. Well, go to the Bush Hotel, in Farnham, on
      Friday afternoon and have tea. She will probably motor there and take tea
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she?&rdquo; cried Hugh eagerly. &ldquo;Will you arrange it? You are, indeed, a
      good Samaritan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little old man smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand that this enforced parting under such circumstances is
      most unfortunate for you both,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I have done, and will
      continue to do, all I can in your interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite make you out, Mr. Peters,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;Why should
      you evince such a paternal interest in me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow did not at once reply. A strange expression played about his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not already answered that question twice?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Rest
      assured, Mr. Henfrey, that I have your interests very much at heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some reason for that, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes, I have a reason&mdash;a reason which is my own affair.&rdquo;
       And he rose to wish his visitor &ldquo;good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget to let Miss Ranscomb know that you will be at Farnham.
      She will, no doubt, manage to get her mother&rsquo;s car for the afternoon,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; and with his gloved fingers he took the young man&rsquo;s
      outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant he heard the front door close he crossed to the telephone, and
      asking for a number, told the person who answered it to come round and see
      him without a moment&rsquo;s delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, while Hugh Henfrey was seated beside Mead as Mrs. Bond&rsquo;s car went
      swiftly towards Kensington, a thin, rather wiry-looking man of middle age
      entered The Sparrow&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter sprang to his feet quickly at sight of his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Howell! I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come. Benton and Molly Maxwell are deceiving
      us. They mean mischief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man he addressed as Howell looked aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mischief?&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not yet arrived at a full conclusion. But we must be on the alert
      and ready to act whenever the time is ripe. You know what they did over
      that little affair in Marseilles not so very long ago? They&rsquo;ll repeat, if
      we&rsquo;re not very careful. That girl of Benton&rsquo;s they are using as a decoy&mdash;and
      she&rsquo;s a dangerous one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For old Henfrey&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow&rsquo;s visitor gave vent to a low whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They intend to get old Henfrey&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and they will if we are not very wary,&rdquo; declared the little,
      bristly-haired old gentleman known as The Sparrow. &ldquo;The boy has been
      entirely entrapped. They made one <i>faux pas</i>, and it is upon that we
      may&mdash;if we are careful&mdash;get the better of them. I don&rsquo;t like the
      situation at all. They have a distinctly evil design against the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benton and Molly are a combination pretty hard to beat,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
      Howell. &ldquo;But I thought they were friends of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. They were. But after the little affair in Marseilles I don&rsquo;t trust
      them,&rdquo; replied The Sparrow. &ldquo;When anyone makes a slip, either by design or
      sheer carelessness, or perhaps by reason of inordinate avarice, then I
      always have to safeguard myself. I suspect&mdash;and my suspicion usually
      proves correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His midnight visitor drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we all say of you is that The Sparrow is gifted with an extra
      sense,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old man with the gloved hand smiled contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I scent danger long before others
      have any suspicion of it. If I did not, you would, many of you who are my
      friends, have been in prison long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have such a marvellous memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Memory!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Quite wrong. I keep everything filed. I work yonder
      at my desk all day. See this old wardrobe,&rdquo; and he crossed to a long,
      genuine Jacobean wardrobe which stood in a corner and, unlocking it,
      opened the carved doors. &ldquo;There you see all my plans arranged and
      docketed. I can tell you what has been attempted to-night. Whether the
      coup is successful I do not yet know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within were shelves containing many bundles of papers, each tied with pink
      tape in legal fashion. He took out a small, black-covered index book and,
      after consulting it, drew out a file of papers from the second shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      These he brought to his table, and opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; he said, knitting his brows as he read a document beneath the
      green-shaded electric lamp. &ldquo;You know Franklyn, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harold Franklyn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well, he&rsquo;s in the Tatra, in Hungary. He and Matthews are with three
      Austrian friends of ours, and to-night they are at the Castle of Szombat,
      belonging to Count Zsolcza, the millionaire banker of Vienna. The Countess
      has some very valuable jewels, which were indicated to me several months
      ago by her discharged lady&rsquo;s maid&mdash;through another channel, of
      course. I hope that before dawn the jewels will be no longer at Szombat,
      for the Count is an old scoundrel who cornered the people&rsquo;s food in
      Austria just before the Armistice and is directly responsible for an
      enormous amount of suffering. The Countess was a cafe singer in Budapest.
      Her name was Anna Torna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Howell sat open-mouthed. He was a crook and the bosom friend of the
      great Passero. Like all others who knew him, he held the master criminal
      in awe and admiration. The Sparrow, whatever he was, never did a mean
      action and never took advantage of youth or inexperience. To his
      finger-tips he was a sportsman, whose chief delight in life was to outwit
      and puzzle the police of Europe. In the underworld he was believed to be
      fabulously wealthy, as no doubt he was. To the outside world he was a very
      rich old gentleman, who contributed generously to charities, kept two fine
      cars, and, as well as his town house, had a pretty place down in
      Gloucestershire, and usually rented a grouse moor in Scotland, where he
      entertained Mr. Howell and several other of his intimate friends who were
      in the same profitable profession as himself, and in whose &ldquo;business&rdquo; he
      held a controlling interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paris, Rome, Madrid, or Brussels, he was well known as an idler who
      stayed at the best hotels and patronized the most expensive restaurants,
      while his villa on the Riviera he had purchased from a Roumanian prince
      who had ruined himself by gambling. His gloved hand&mdash;gloved because
      of a natural deformity&mdash;was the hand which controlled most of the
      greater robberies, for his war upon society was constantly far-reaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Franklyn coming straight back?&rdquo; asked Howell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the plan. He should leave Vienna to-morrow night,&rdquo; said The
      Sparrow, again consulting the papers. &ldquo;And he comes home with all speed.
      But first he travels to Brussels, and afterwards to The Hague, where he
      will hand over Anna Torna&rsquo;s jewels to old Van Ort, and they&rsquo;ll be cut out
      of all recognition by the following day. Franklyn will then cross from the
      Hook to Harwich. He will wire me his departure from Vienna. He&rsquo;s bought a
      car for the job, and will have to abandon it somewhere outside of Vienna,
      for, as in most of our games, time is the essence of the contract,&rdquo; and
      the old fellow laughed oddly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Franklyn worked with Molly,&rdquo; said Mr. Howell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he does. I want him back, for I&rsquo;ve a delicate mission for him,&rdquo;
       replied the sphinx-like man known as The Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Howell, at the invitation of the arch-criminal, helped himself to a
      drink. Then The Sparrow said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are due to leave London the day after to-morrow on that little
      business in Madrid. You must remain in town. I may want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. But Tresham is already there. I had a letter from him from the
      Palace Hotel yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will recall him by wire to-morrow. Our plans are complete. The
      Marquis&rsquo;s picture will still hang in his house until we are ready for it.
      It is the best specimen of Antonio del Rincon, and will fetch a big price
      in New York&mdash;when we have time to go and get it,&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Franklyn to help the Maxwell woman again?&rdquo; asked Mr. Howell, who was
      known as an expert valuer of antiques and articles of worth, and who had
      an office in St. James&rsquo;s. He only dealt in collectors&rsquo; pieces, and in the
      trade bore an unblemished reputation, on account of his expert knowledge
      and his sound financial condition. He bought old masters and pieces of
      antique silver now and then, but none suspected that the genuine purchases
      at big prices were only made in order to blind his friends as to the
      actual nature of his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, to his office came many an art gem stolen from its owner on the
      Continent and smuggled over by devious ways known only to The Sparrow and
      his associates. And just as ingeniously the stolen property was sent
      across to America, so well camouflaged that the United States Customs
      officers were deceived. With pictures it was their usual method to coat
      the genuine picture with a certain varnish, over which one of the
      organization, an old artist living in Chelsea, would paint a modern and
      quite passable picture and add a new canvas back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, on its arrival in America, the new picture was easily cleaned off,
      the back removed, and lo! it was an old master once more ready for
      purchase at a high price by American collectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, the gloved hand of The Sparrow was a master hand. He had brought
      well-financed and well-organized theft to a fine art. His &ldquo;indicators,&rdquo;
       both male and female, were everywhere, and cosmopolitan as he was himself,
      and a wealthy man, he was able to direct&mdash;and finance&mdash;all sorts
      of coups, from a barefaced jewel theft to the forgery of American
      banknotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, so strange and mysterious a personality was he that not twenty
      persons in the whole criminal world had ever met him in the flesh. The
      tall, good-looking man whom Dorise knew as the White Cavalier was one of
      four other men who posed in his stead when occasion arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotland Yard, the Surete in Paris, the Pubblica Sicurezza in Rome, and
      the Detective Department of the New York police knew, quite naturally, of
      the existence of the elusive Sparrow, but none of them had been able to
      trace him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? Because he was only the brains of the great, widespread criminal
      organization. He remained in smug respectability, while others beneath his
      hand carried out his orders&mdash;they were the servants, well-paid too,
      and he was the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more widespread nor more wonderful criminal combine had ever been
      organized than that headed by The Sparrow, the little old man whom
      Londoners believed to be Cockney, yet Italians believed to be pure-bred
      Tuscan, while in Paris he was a true Parisian who could speak the argot of
      the Montmartre without a trace of English accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a politician, as a City man, as a professional man, The Sparrow, whose
      real name was as obscure as his personality, would have made his mark. If
      a lawyer, he would have secured the honour of a knighthood&mdash;or of a
      baronetcy, and more than probable he would have entered Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow was a philosopher, and a thorough-going Englishman to boot.
      Though none knew it, he was able by his unique knowledge of the underworld
      of Europe to give information&mdash;as he did anonymously to the War
      Office&mdash;of certain trusted persons who were, at the moment of the
      outbreak of war, betraying Britain&rsquo;s secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department of Military Operations was, by means of the anonymous
      information, able to quash a gigantic German plot against us; but they had
      been unable to discover either the true source of their information or the
      identity of their informant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better be off. It&rsquo;s late!&rdquo; said Mr. Howell, after they had been in
      close conversation for nearly half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I suppose you must go,&rdquo; The Sparrow remarked, rising. &ldquo;I must get
      Franklyn back. He must get to the bottom of this curious affair. I fell
      that I am being bamboozled by Benton and Molly Maxwell. The boy is
      innocent&mdash;he is their victim,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;but if I can save him, by
      gad! I will! Yet it will be difficult. There is much trouble ahead, I
      anticipate, and it is up to us, Howell, to combat it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Franklyn can assist us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. I shall not, however, know before he gets back here from his
      adventures in Hungary. But I tell you, Howell, I am greatly concerned
      about the lad. He has fallen into the hands of a bad crowd&mdash;a very
      bad crowd indeed.&rdquo;

      TWENTIETH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MAN WHO KNEW
    </h3>
    <p>
      Late on Thursday night Dorise and her mother were driving home from Lady
      Strathbayne&rsquo;s, in Grosvenor Square, where they had been dining. It was a
      bright starlight night, and the myriad lamps of the London traffic flashed
      past the windows as Dorise sat back in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was tired. The dinner had been followed by a small dance, and she had
      greatly enjoyed it. For once, George Sherrard, her mother&rsquo;s friend, had
      not accompanied them. As a matter of fact, Lady Strathbayne disliked the
      man, hence he had not been invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Lady Ranscomb exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard about Hugh Henfrey this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom?&rdquo; asked her daughter, instantly aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From that man who took me in to dinner. I think his name was Bowden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! That stout, red-faced man. I don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I. He was, however, very pleasant, and seems to have travelled
      a lot,&rdquo; replied her mother. &ldquo;He told me that your precious friend,
      Henfrey, is back, and is staying down in Surrey as guest of some woman
      named Bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorise sat staggered. Then her lover&rsquo;s secret was out! If his whereabouts
      were known in Society, then the police would quickly get upon his track!
      She felt she must warn him instantly of his peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he know, I wonder?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I suppose he&rsquo;s heard. He seemed to know all about the fellow. It
      appears that at last he&rsquo;s become engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engaged? Hugh engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to a girl named Louise Lambert. She&rsquo;s the adopted daughter of a man
      named Benton, who was, by the way, a great friend of old Mr. Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh engaged to Louise Lambert! Dorise sat bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; she blurted forth at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear. You mean you don&rsquo;t want to believe it&mdash;because you are
      in love with him!&rdquo; said her mother as the car rushed homeward. &ldquo;Now put
      all this silly girlish nonsense aside. The fellow is under a cloud, and no
      good. I tell you frankly I will never have him as my son-in-law. How he
      has escaped the police is a marvel; but if the man Bowden knows where he
      is, Scotland Yard will, no doubt, soon hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl remained silent. Could it be possible that, after all, Hugh had
      asked Louise Lambert to be his wife? She had known of her, and had met her
      with Hugh, but he had always assured her that they were merely friends.
      Yet it appeared that he was now living in concealment under the same roof
      as she!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ranscomb, clever woman of the world as she was, watched her
      daughter&rsquo;s face in the fleeting lights as they sped homeward, and saw what
      a crushing blow the announcement had dealt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; the girl cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had received word in secret&mdash;presumably from the White Cavalier&mdash;to
      meet Hugh at the Bush Hotel at Farnham on the following afternoon, but
      this secret news held her in doubt and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ranscomb dropped the subject, and began to speak of other things&mdash;of
      a visit to the flying-ground at Hendon on the following day, and of an
      invitation they had received to spend the following week with a friend at
      Cowes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arrival home Dorise went at once to her room, where her maid awaited
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the distracted girl had thrown off her cloak, her maid unhooked her
      dress, whereupon Dorise dismissed her to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to read, so go to bed,&rdquo; she said in a petulant voice which rather
      surprised the neat muslin-aproned maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, miss. Good-night,&rdquo; the latter replied meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as the door was closed Dorise flung herself upon the
      chintz-covered couch and wept bitterly as though her heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had met Louise Lambert&mdash;it was Hugh who had introduced them.
      George Sherrard had several times told her of the friendship between the
      pair, and one night at the Haymarket Theatre she had seen them together in
      a box. On another occasion she had met them at Ciro&rsquo;s, and they had been
      together at the Embassy, at Ranelagh, and yet again she had seen them
      lunching together one Sunday at the Metropole at Brighton.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had aroused suspicion and jealousy in her mind. It was all very
      well for Hugh to disclaim anything further than pure friendship, but now
      that Gossip was casting her hydra-headed venom upon their affairs, it was
      surely time to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh would be awaiting her at Farnham next afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed to the window and looked at the bright stars. In war time she
      used to see the long beams of searchlights playing to and fro. But now all
      was peace in London, and the world-war half forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within herself arose a great struggle. Hugh was accused of a crime&mdash;an
      accusation of which he could not clear himself. He had been hunted across
      Europe by the police and had, up to the present, been successful in
      slipping through their fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why did he visit that notorious woman at that hour of the night? What
      could have been the secret bond between them?
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman had narrowly escaped death presumably on account of his
      murderous attack upon her, while he had cleverly evaded arrest, until, at
      the present moment, his whereabouts was known only to a dinner-table
      gossip, and he was staying in the same house as the girl, love for whom he
      had always so vehemently disclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Dorise spent a sleepless night. She lay awake thinking&mdash;and yet
      thinking!
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast her mother looked at her and, with satisfaction, saw that she
      had gained a point nearer her object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise went into Bond Street shopping at eleven o&rsquo;clock, still undecided
      whether to face Hugh or not. The shopping was a fiasco. She bought only a
      bunch of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in her walk she made a resolve not to make further excuse. She would
      not ask her mother for the car, and Hugh, by waiting alone, should be left
      guessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning home, her mother told her of George&rsquo;s acceptance of an
      invitation to lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a matinee at the Lyric, and he&rsquo;s taking us there,&rdquo; she added.
      &ldquo;But, dear,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you look ever so pale! What is worrying you? I
      hope you are not fretting over that good-for-nothing waster, Henfrey!
      Personally, I&rsquo;m glad to be rid of a fellow who is wanted by the police for
      a very serious crime. Do brighten up, dear. This is not like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;well, mother, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; the girl
      confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do! Take my advice, darling. Think no more of the fellow. He&rsquo;s no use to
      you&mdash;or to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mother dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dorise, no more need be said!&rdquo; interrupted Lady Ranscomb severely.
      &ldquo;You surely would not be so idiotic as to throw in your lot with a man who
      is certainly a criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A criminal! Why do you denounce him, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he stands self-condemned. He has been in hiding ever since that
      night at Monte Carlo. If he were innocent, he would surely, for your sake,
      come forward and clear himself. Are you mad, Dorise&mdash;or are you
      blind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl remained silent. Her mother&rsquo;s argument was certainly a very sound
      one. Had Hugh deceived her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lover&rsquo;s attitude was certainly that of a guilty man. She could not
      disguise from herself the fact that he was fleeing from justice, and that
      he was unable to give an explanation why he went to the house of
      Mademoiselle at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne Ferad, the only person who could tell the truth, was a hopeless
      idiot because of the murderous attack. Hence, the onus of clearing himself
      rested upon Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved him, but could she really trust him in face of the fact that he
      was concealed comfortably beneath the same roof as Louise Lambert?
    </p>
    <p>
      She recalled that once, when they had met at Newquay in Cornwall over a
      tete-a-tete lunch, he had said, in reply to her banter, that Louise was a
      darling! That he was awfully fond of her, that she had the most wonderful
      eyes, and that she was always alert and full of a keen sense of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a compliment Hugh had never paid to her. The recollection of it stung
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered what sort of woman was the person named Bond. Then she
      decided that she had acted wisely in not going to Farnham. Why should she?
      If Hugh was with the girl he admired, then he might return with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her only fear was lest he should be arrested. If his place of concealment
      were spoken of over a West End dinner-table, then it could not be long
      before detectives arrested him for the affair at the Villa Amette.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that afternoon Hugh had borrowed Mrs. Bond&rsquo;s car upon a rather lame
      pretext, and had pulled up in the square, inartistic yard before the Bush&mdash;the
      old coaching house, popular before the new road over the Hog&rsquo;s Back was
      made, and when the coaches had to ascend that steep hill out of Guildford,
      now known as The Mount. For miles the old road is now grass-grown and
      forms a most delightful walk, with magnificent views from the Thames
      Valley to the South Downs. The days of the coaches have, alas! passed, and
      the new road, with its tangle of telegraph wires, is beloved by every
      motorist and motor-cyclist who spins westward in Surrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh waited anxiously in the little lounge which overlooks the courtyard.
      He went into the garden, and afterwards stood in impatience beneath the
      archway from which the street is approached. Later, he strolled along the
      road over which he knew Dorise must come. But all to no avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sign of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until six o&rsquo;clock he waited, when, in blank despair, he mounted beside
      Mead again and drove back to Shapley Manor. It was curious that Dorise had
      not come to meet him, but he attributed it to The Sparrow&rsquo;s inability to
      convey a message to her. She might have gone out of town with her mother,
      he thought. Or, perhaps, at the last moment, she had been unable to get
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to Shapley he found Louise and Mrs. Bond sitting together in
      the charming, old-world drawing-room. A log fire was burning brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have a nice run, Hugh?&rdquo; asked the girl, clasping her hands behind
      her head and looking up at him as he stood upon the pale-blue hearthrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I went around Hindhead down to Frensham Ponds and
      back through Farnham&mdash;quite a pleasant run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Benton has had to go to town,&rdquo; said his hostess. &ldquo;Almost as soon as
      you had gone he was rung up, and he had to get a taxi out from Guildford.
      He&rsquo;ll be back to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;and, by the way, Hugh,&rdquo; exclaimed Louise, &ldquo;there was a call
      for you about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I thought nobody knew you
      were down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me!&rdquo; gasped Henfrey, instantly alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I answered the &lsquo;phone. It was a girl&rsquo;s voice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl! Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who she was. She wouldn&rsquo;t give her name,&rdquo; Louise replied.
      &ldquo;She asked if we were Shapley, and I replied. Then she asked for you. I
      told her that you were out in the car and asked her name. But she said it
      didn&rsquo;t matter at all, and rang off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder who she was?&rdquo; remarked Hugh, much puzzled and, at the same time,
      greatly alarmed. He scented danger. The fact in itself showed that
      somebody knew the secret of his hiding-place, and, if they did, then the
      police were bound to discover him sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterwards he took Mrs. Bond aside, and pointed out the peril
      in which he was placed. His hostess, on her part, grew alarmed, for though
      Hugh was unaware of it, she had no desire to meet the police. That little
      affair in Paris was by no means forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly rather curious,&rdquo; the woman admitted. &ldquo;Evidently it is
      known by somebody that you are staying with me. Don&rsquo;t you think it would
      be wiser to leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh hesitated. He wished to take Benton&rsquo;s advice, and told his hostess
      so. With this she agreed, yet she was inwardly highly nervous at the
      situation. Any police inquiry at Shapley would certainly be most unwelcome
      to her, and she blamed herself for agreeing to Benton&rsquo;s proposal that Hugh
      should stay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benton will be back to-morrow,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;Do you think it safe for me
      to remain here till then?&rdquo; he added anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know what to think,&rdquo; replied the woman. She herself had a
      haunting dread of recognition as Molly Maxwell. She had crossed and
      recrossed the Atlantic, carefully covering her tracks, and she did not
      intend to be cornered at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, Hugh, still greatly perturbed at the mysterious telephone
      call, played billiards with Louise. About a quarter to eleven, however,
      Mrs. Bond was called to the telephone and, closing the door, listened to
      an urgent message.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from Benton, who spoke from London&mdash;a few quick, cryptic, but
      reassuring words&mdash;and when the woman left the room three minutes
      later all her anxiety as to the police had apparently passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She joined the young couple and watched their game. Louise handled her cue
      well, and very nearly beat her opponent. Afterwards, when Louise went out,
      Mrs. Bond closed the door swiftly, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking over that little matter, Mr. Henfrey. I really don&rsquo;t
      think there is much cause for alarm. Charles will be back to-morrow, and
      we can consult him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh shrugged his shoulders. He was much puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Mrs. Bond, I&rsquo;m tired of being hunted like this!&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;This eternal fear of arrest has got upon my nerves to such an extent that
      I feel if they want to bring me for trial&mdash;well, they can. I&rsquo;m
      innocent&mdash;therefore, how can they prove me guilty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you mustn&rsquo;t let it obsess you,&rdquo; the woman urged. &ldquo;Mr. Benton has told
      me all about the unfortunate affair, and I greatly sympathize with you. Of
      course, to court the publicity of a trial would be fatal. What would your
      poor father think, I wonder, if he were still alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; said the young man in a low, hoarse voice; &ldquo;but Mademoiselle
      Ferad knows the secret of his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died suddenly&mdash;did he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He was murdered, Mrs. Bond. I&rsquo;m certain of it. My father was
      murdered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murdered?&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;What did the doctors say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They arrived at no definite conclusion,&rdquo; was Hugh&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;He left
      home and went up to London on some secret and mysterious errand. Later, he
      was found lying upon the pavement in a dying condition. He never recovered
      consciousness, but sank a few hours afterwards. His death is one of the
      many unsolved mysteries of London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police believe that you went to the Villa Amette and murdered
      Mademoiselle out of revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them prove it!&rdquo; said the young fellow defiantly. &ldquo;Let them prove it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove what?&rdquo; asked Louise, as she suddenly reopened the door, greatly to
      the woman&rsquo;s consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Only somebody&mdash;that Spicer woman over at Godalming&mdash;has
      been saying some wicked and nasty things about Mr. Henfrey,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
      Bond. &ldquo;Personally, I should be annoyed. Really those gossiping people are
      simply intolerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have they been saying, Hugh?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s really nothing,&rdquo; laughed Henfrey. &ldquo;I apologize. I was put out a
      moment ago, but I now see the absurdity of it. Forgive me, Louise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked from Mrs. Bond to her guest in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to forgive?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact that I was in the very act of losing my temper. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently, when Louise was ascending the stairs with Mrs. Bond, the girl
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was Hugh so put out? What has Mrs. Spicer been saying about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that he was a shirker during the war. And, naturally, he is highly
      indignant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a right to be. He did splendidly. His record shows that,&rdquo; declared
      the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I urged him to take no notice of the insults. The Spicer woman has a very
      venomous tongue, my dear! She is a vicar&rsquo;s widow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then they separated to their respective rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Hugh Henfrey retired, but he found sleep impossible; so
      he got up and sat at the open window, gazing across to the dim outlines of
      the Surrey hills, picturesque and undulating beneath the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who could have called him on the telephone? It was a woman, but the voice
      might have been that of a female telephone operator. Or yet&mdash;it might
      have been that of Dorise! She knew that he was at Shapley and looked it up
      in the telephone directory. If that were the explanation, then she
      certainly would not give away the secret of his hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he was haunted by a great dread the whole of that night. The Sparrow
      had told him he had acted foolishly in leaving his place of concealment in
      Kensington. The Sparrow was his firm friend, and in future he intended to
      obey the little old man&rsquo;s orders implicitly&mdash;as so many others did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he came down to breakfast before the ladies, and beside his
      plate he found a letter&mdash;addressed to him openly. He had not received
      one addressed in his real name for many months. Sight of it caused his
      heart to bound in anxiety, but when he read it he stood rooted to the
      spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those lines which he read staggered him; the room seemed to revolve, and
      he re-read them, scarce believing his own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized in that instant that a great blow had fallen upon him, and
      that all was now hopeless. The sunshine of his life, had in that single
      instant, been blotted out!

    <h2>
      TWENTY-FIRST CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MAN WITH MANY NAMES
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the moment he had read the letter Mrs. Bond entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! You&rsquo;re down early,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;And already had your letters, I
      see! They don&rsquo;t generally come so early. The postman has to walk over from
      Puttenham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she took up her own and carelessly placed them aside. They consisted
      mostly of circulars and the accounts of Guildford tradesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was down early. Lately I&rsquo;ve acquired the habit of early
      rising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excellent habit in a young man,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;All men who achieve
      success are early risers&mdash;so a Cabinet Minister said the other day.
      And really, I believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour in the early morning is worth three after dinner. That is why
      Cabinet Ministers entertain people at breakfast nowadays instead of at
      dinner. In the morning the brain is fresh and active&mdash;a fact recently
      discovered in our post-war days,&rdquo; Hugh said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as his hostess turned to the hot-plate upon the sideboard, lifting
      the covers to see what her cook had provided, he re-scanned the letter
      which had been openly addressed to him. It was from Dorise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse to be deceived any longer, I have discovered that you are now a
      fellow-guest with the girl Louise, to whom you introduced me. And yet you
      arranged to meet me at Farnham, believing that I was not aware of your
      close friendship with her! I have believed in you up to the present, but
      the scales have now fallen from my eyes. I thought you loved me too well
      to deceive me&mdash;as you are doing. Hard things are being said about you&mdash;but
      you can rest content that I shall reveal nothing that I happen to know.
      What I do know, however, has changed my thoughts concerning you. I
      believed you to be the victim of circumstance. Now I know you have
      deceived me, and that I, myself, am the victim. I need only add that
      someone else&mdash;whom I know not&mdash;knows of your hiding-place, for,
      by a roundabout way, I heard of it, and hence, I address this letter to
      you.&mdash;DORISE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey stood staggered. There was no mistaking the meaning of that
      letter now that he had read it a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise doubted him! And what answer could he give her? Any explanation
      must, to her, be but a lame excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh ate his breakfast sullenly. To Louise, who put in a late appearance,
      and helped herself off the hot-plate, he said cheerfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lazy you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not laziness, Hugh,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;The maid was so late with my
      tea&mdash;and&mdash;well, to tell the truth, I upset a whole new box of
      powder on my dressing-table and had to clean up the mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More haste&mdash;less speed,&rdquo; laughed Hugh. &ldquo;It is always the same in the
      morning&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the girl sat down at the table Hugh had brightened up. Still the load
      upon his shoulders was a heavy one. He was ever obsessed by the mystery of
      his father&rsquo;s death, combined with that extraordinary will by which it was
      decreed that if he married Louise he would acquire his father&rsquo;s fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise was certainly very good-looking, and quite charming. He admitted
      that as he gazed across at her fresh figure on the opposite side of the
      table. He, of course, was in ignorance of the fact that Benton, who had
      adopted her, was a clever and unscrupulous adventurer, whose accomplice
      was the handsome woman who was his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, he never dreamed that that quiet and respectable house, high on
      the beautiful Surrey hills, was the abode of a woman for whom the police
      of Europe were everywhere searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts all through breakfast were of The Sparrow&mdash;the great
      criminal, who was his friend. Hence, after they rose, he strolled into the
      morning-room with his hostess, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go to town again this morning. I have an urgent letter. Can
      Mead take me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; was the woman&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;I have to make a call at Worplesdon
      this afternoon, and Louise is going with me. But Mead can be back before
      then to take us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So half an hour later Hugh was driving up the steep High Street of
      Guildford on his way to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He alighted in Piccadilly, at the end of Half Moon Street, soon after
      eleven, and, dismissing Mead, made his way to Ellerston Street to the
      house of Mr. George Peters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell at the old-fashioned mansion, and a few moments later the
      door was opened by the manservant he had previously seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the servant recognized the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Peters will not be in for a quarter of an hour,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would you
      care to wait, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Hugh replied. &ldquo;I want to see him very urgently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come in? Mr. Peters has left instructions that you might
      probably call; Mr. Henfrey, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Hugh. The man seemed to possess a memory like that of a
      club hall-porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Henfrey was ushered into a small but cosy little room, which, in the
      light of day, he saw was well-furnished and upholstered. The door closed,
      and he waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments after he distinctly heard a man&rsquo;s voice, which he at once
      recognized as that of The Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant had told him that Mr. Peters was absent, yet he recognized his
      voice&mdash;a rather high-pitched, musical one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Henfrey is waiting,&rdquo; he heard the servant say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right! I hope you told him I was out,&rdquo; The Sparrow replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh stood there very much puzzled. The room was cosy and well-furnished,
      but the light was somewhat dim, while the atmosphere was decidedly murky,
      as it is in any house in Mayfair. One cannot obtain brightness and light
      in a West End house, where one&rsquo;s vista is bounded by bricks and mortar.
      The dukes in their great town mansions are no better off for light and air
      than the hard-working and worthy wage-earners of Walworth, Deptford, or
      Peckham. The air in the working-class districts of London is not one whit
      worse than it is in Mayfair or in Belgravia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh stood before an old coloured print representing the hobby-horse
      school&mdash;the days of the &ldquo;bone-shakers&rdquo;&mdash;and studied it. He
      awaited Il Passero and the advice which he had promised to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      His ears were strained. That house was curiously quiet and forbidding. The
      White Cavalier, whom he had believed to be the notorious Sparrow, had been
      proved to be one of his assistants. He had now met the real, elusive
      adventurer, who controlled half the criminal adventurers in Europe, and
      had found in him a most genial friend. He was there to seek his advice and
      to act upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he reflected, he realized that without the aid of The Sparrow he would
      have long ago been in the hands of the police. So widespread was the
      organization which The Sparrow controlled that it mattered not in what
      capital he might be, the paternal hand of protection was placed upon him&mdash;in
      Genoa, in Brussels, in London&mdash;anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that when The Sparrow protected any criminal the fugitive was
      safe. He had been sent to Mrs. Mason in Kensington, and he had left her
      room against The Sparrow&rsquo;s will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence his peril of arrest. It was that point which he wished to discuss
      with the great arch-criminal of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      That house was one of mystery. The servant had told him that he was
      expected. Why? What did The Sparrow suspect?
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole atmosphere of that old-fashioned place was mysterious and
      apprehensive. And yet its owner had succeeded in extricating him from that
      very perilous position at Monte Carlo!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as he stood there, he heard voices again. They were raised in
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      One voice he recognized as that of The Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I tell you my view is still the same,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What you have
      told me does not alter it, however much you may ridicule me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know the truth&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t say so, my dear Howell. But I have my suspicions&mdash;strong
      suspicions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you will, in due course, impart to young Henfrey, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; was The Sparrow&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;The lad is in
      serious peril. I happen to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you warn him at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my affair!&rdquo; snapped the gentleman known in Mayfair as Mr. Peters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;IF Henfrey is here, then I&rsquo;d like to meet him,&rdquo; Howell said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as though the pair were in a room on the opposite side of the
      passage, and yet, though Hugh stood at some distance away, he could hear
      the words quite distinctly. At this he was much surprised. He did not,
      however, know that in that house in Ellerston Street there had been
      constructed a curious system of ventilation of the rooms by which a
      conversation taking place in a distant apartment could be heard in certain
      other rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that The Sparrow received a good many queer visitors, and
      some of their whispered conversations while they awaited him were often
      full of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was, in more than one way, a curiosity. It had a secret exit
      through a mews at the rear&mdash;now converted into a garage&mdash;and
      several other mysterious contrivances which were unsuspected by visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would hardly do for him to know what we know, Mr. Peters&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
       Hugh heard Howell say a moment later. It was the habit of The Sparrow&rsquo;s
      accomplices to address their great director&mdash;the brain of criminal
      Europe&mdash;by the name under which they inquired for him. The Sparrow
      had twenty names&mdash;one for every city in which he had a cosy <i>pied-a-terre</i>.
      In Paris, Lisbon, Madrid, Marseilles, Vienna, Hamburg, Budapest, Stockholm
      and on the Riviera, he was, in all the cities, known by a different name.
      Yet each was so distinct, and each individuality so well kept up, that he
      snapped his fingers at the police and pitied them their red tape,
      ignorance, and lack of initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, Il Passero, the cosmopolitan of many names and half a dozen
      nationalities, had brought criminality to a fine art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh, standing there breathless, listened to every word. Who was this man
      Howell?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried The Sparrow suddenly. &ldquo;What a fool I am! I quite forgot to
      close the ventilator in the room to which the young fellow has been shown!
      I hope he hasn&rsquo;t overheard! I had Evans and Janson in there an hour ago,
      and they were discussing me, as I expected they would! It was a good job
      that I took the precaution of opening the ventilator, because I learned a
      good deal that I had never suspected. It has placed me on my guard. I&rsquo;ll
      go and get young Henfrey. But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;be extremely careful. Disclose
      nothing you know concerning the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be discreet, never fear,&rdquo; replied his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later The Sparrow entered the room where Henfrey was, and greeted
      him warmly. Then he ushered him down the passage to the room wherein stood
      his mysterious visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was such a distance away that Hugh was surprised that he could
      have heard so distinctly. But, after all, it was an uncanny experience to
      be associated with that man of mystery, whose very name was uttered by his
      accomplices with bated breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, Mr. George Howell,&rdquo; said The Sparrow, introducing the slim,
      wiry-looking, middle-aged man, who was alert and clean-shaven, and plainly
      but well dressed&mdash;a man whom the casual acquaintance would take to be
      a solicitor of a fair practice. He bore the stamp of suburbia all over
      him, and his accent was peculiarly that of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bearing was that of high respectability. The diamond scarf-pin was his
      only ornament&mdash;a fine one, which sparkled even in that dull London
      light. He was a square-shouldered man, with peculiarly shrewd, rather
      narrow eyes, and dark, bushy eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to meet you, Mr. Henfrey,&rdquo; he replied, with a gay, rather nonchalant
      air. &ldquo;My friend Mr. Peters has been speaking about you. Had a rather
      anxious time, I hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henfrey looked at the stranger inquisitively, and then glanced at The
      Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Howell is quite safe,&rdquo; declared the man with the gloved hand. &ldquo;He is
      one of Us. So you may speak without fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;the fact is, I&rsquo;ve had a very apprehensive
      time. I&rsquo;m here to seek Mr. Peters&rsquo; kind advice, for without him I&rsquo;m sure
      I&rsquo;d have been arrested and perhaps convicted long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! A bit of bad luck&mdash;eh? Nearly found out, have you been? Ah! All
      of us have our narrow escapes. I&rsquo;ve had many in my time,&rdquo; and he grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have all of us,&rdquo; laughed the bristly-haired man. &ldquo;But tell me,
      Henfrey, why have you come to see me so quickly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they know where I&rsquo;m in hiding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know? Who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Ranscomb knows my whereabouts and has written to me in my real name
      and addressed the letter to Shapley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I told her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She tells me that my present hiding-place is known!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not known to the police? <i>Impossible</i>!&rdquo; gasped the black-gloved man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it that such is a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Molly is there!&rdquo; cried the man Howell. &ldquo;If the police suspect that
      Henfrey is at Shapley, then they&rsquo;ll visit the place and have a decided
      haul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Hugh in ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I never discuss other people&rsquo;s private affairs, Mr. Henfrey,&rdquo;
       Howell answered very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh was surprised at the familiar mention of &ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; and the declaration
      that if the Manor were searched the police would have &ldquo;a decided haul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very interesting,&rdquo; declared The Sparrow. &ldquo;What did Miss Ranscomb
      say in her letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a second Hugh hesitated; then, drawing it from his pocket, he gave it
      to the gloved man to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh knew that The Sparrow was withholding certain truths from him, yet
      had he not already proved himself his best and only friend? Brock was a
      good friend, but unable to assist him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow&rsquo;s strongly marked face changed as he read Dorise&rsquo;s angry
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;I will see her. We must discover why she has sent you
      this warning. Come back again this evening. But be very careful where you
      go in the meantime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus dismissed, Hugh walked along Ellerston Street into Curzon Street
      towards Piccadilly, not knowing where to go to spend the intervening
      hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant he had gone, however, The Sparrow turned to his companion, who
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Lisette has revealed anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; remarked The Sparrow, for once suddenly perturbed. <i>&ldquo;I never
      thought of that!&rdquo;</i>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;recollect how much the girl knows!&rdquo; Howell remarked as he
      stood before The Sparrow in the latter&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not forgotten,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;The whole circumstances of old
      Henfrey&rsquo;s death are not known to me. That it was an unfortunate affair has

      &ldquo;Yvonne was the culprit, of course,&rdquo; said Howell. &ldquo;That was apparent from
      the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she was,&rdquo; remarked The Sparrow reflectively. &ldquo;But that attempt
      upon her life puzzles me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who could have greater motive in killing her out of revenge than the dead
      man&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed. But I am convinced that the lad is innocent. Therefore I gave him
      our protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was travelling abroad at the time, you recollect. When I learnt of the
      affair through Franklyn about a week afterwards I was amazed. The loss of
      Yvonne to us is a serious one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very&mdash;I agree. She had done some excellent work&mdash;the affair in
      the Rue Royale, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the clever ruse by which she got those emeralds of the Roumanian
      princess. The Vienna police are still searching for her&mdash;after three
      years,&rdquo; laughed the companion of the chief of the international
      organization, whose word was law in the criminal underworld of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowing what you did regarding the knowledge of old Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s death
      possessed by Lisette, I have been surprised that you placed her beneath
      your protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she had been arrested she might have told some very unpleasant truths,
      in order to save herself,&rdquo; The Sparrow remarked, &ldquo;so I chose the latter
      evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Henfrey met her. I wonder whether she told him anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I questioned her. She was discreet, it seems. Or at least, she
      declares that she was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good feature. But, speaking frankly, have you any idea of the
      identity of the person&mdash;man or woman&mdash;who attempted to kill
      Yvonne?&rdquo; asked Howell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a suspicion&mdash;a pretty shrewd suspicion,&rdquo; replied the little
      bristly-haired man.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t offer to confide in me your suspicions&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wiser to obtain proof before making any allegations,&rdquo; answered The
      Sparrow, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will still protect Lisette?&rdquo; Howell asked. &ldquo;I agree that, like
      Yvonne, she has been of great use to us in many ways. Beauty and wit are
      always assets in our rather ticklish branch of commerce. Where is Lisette
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the moment, she&rsquo;s in Madrid,&rdquo; The Sparrow replied. &ldquo;There is a little
      affair there&mdash;the jewels of a Belgian&rsquo;s wife&mdash;a fellow who,
      successfully posing as a German during the occupation of Brussels, made a
      big fortune by profiteering in leather. They are in Madrid for six months,
      in order to escape unwelcome inquiries by the Government in Brussels. They
      have a villa just outside the city, and I have sent Lisette there with
      certain instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody yet. Franklyn will go in due course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Howell&rsquo;s thin lips relaxed into a curious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Franklyn is in love with Lisette,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I am sending them together to execute the little mission,&rdquo;
       The Sparrow said. &ldquo;Lisette was here a fortnight ago, and I mapped out for
      her a plan. I went myself to Madrid not long ago, in order to survey the
      situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The game is worth the candle, I suppose&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If we get the lot Van Groot, in Amsterdam, will give at least
      fifteen thousand for them. Moulaert bought most of them from old Leplae in
      the Rue de la Paix. There are some beautiful rubies among them. I saw
      Madame wearing some of the jewels at the Palace Hotel, in Madrid, while
      they were staying there before their villa was ready. Moulaert, with his
      wife and two friends from the Belgian Legation, dined at a table next to
      mine, little dreaming with what purpose I ate my meal alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Truly, the intuition and cleverness of The Sparrow were wonderful. He
      never moved without fully considering every phase of the consequences.
      Unlike most adventurers, he drank hardly anything. Half a glass of dry
      sherry at eleven in the morning, the same at luncheon, and one glass of
      claret for his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet often at restaurants he would order champagne, choice vintage clarets,
      and liqueurs&mdash;when occasion demanded. He would offer them to his
      friends, but just sip them himself, having previously arranged with the
      waiter to miss filling his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the peril of drink &ldquo;Mr. Peters&rdquo; was constantly lecturing the great
      circle of his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each year&mdash;on the 26th of February to be exact&mdash;there was held a
      dinner at a well-known restaurant in the West End&mdash;the annual dinner
      of a club known as &ldquo;The Wonder Wizards.&rdquo; It was supposed to be a circle of
      professional conjurers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dinner was usually attended by fifty guests of both sexes, all
      well-dressed and prosperous, and of several nationalities. It was presided
      over by a Mr. Charles Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, to tell the truth, the guests believed him to be The Sparrow; but in
      reality Mr. Williams was the tall White Cavalier whom Hugh had believed to
      be the great leader, until he had gone to Mayfair and met the impelling
      personality whom the police had for so long failed to arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was indeed humorous. It was The Sparrow&rsquo;s fancy to hold the
      reunion at a public restaurant instead of at a private house. Under the
      very nose of Scotland Yard the deputy of the notorious Sparrow entertained
      the chiefs of the great criminal octopus. There were speeches, but from
      them the waiters learned nothing. It was simply a club of conjurers. None
      suspected that the guests were those who conjured fortunes out of the
      pockets of the unsuspecting. And while the chairman&mdash;believed by
      those who attended to be The Sparrow himself&mdash;sat there, the
      bristly-haired, rather insignificant-looking little man occupied a seat in
      a far-off corner, from where he scrutinized his guests very closely, and
      smiled at the excellent manner in which his deputy performed the duties of
      chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it was a club of conjurers, and because the conjurers displayed
      their new tricks and illusions, after an excellent dinner the waiters were
      excluded and the doors locked after the coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that the bogus Sparrow addressed those present, and gave
      certain instructions which were later on carried into every corner of
      Europe. Each member had his speciality, and each group its district and
      its sanctuary, in case of a hue-and-cry. Every crime that could be
      committed was committed by them&mdash;everything save murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall, thin man whom everyone believed to be The Sparrow never failed
      to impress upon his hearers, after the doors were carefully locked, that
      however they might attack and rob the rich, human life was sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the real Sparrow&rsquo;s order. He abominated the thought of taking human
      life, hence when old Mr. Henfrey had been foully done to death in the West
      End he had at once set to work to discover the actual criminal. This he
      had failed to do. And afterwards there had followed the attempted
      assassination of Yvonne Ferad, known as Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men stood discussing the young French girl, Lisette, whom Hugh had
      met when in hiding in the Via della Maddalena in Genoa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope; that she has not told young Henfrey anything,&rdquo; Howell said,
      with distinct apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed The Sparrow. &ldquo;She came to me and told me how she had met him
      in Genoa and discovered to her amazement that he was old Henfrey&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How curious that the pair should meet by accident,&rdquo; remarked Howell. &ldquo;I
      tell you that Benton is not playing a straight game. That iniquitous will
      which the old man left he surely must have signed under some
      misapprehension. Perhaps he thought he was applying for a life policy&mdash;or
      something of that short. Signatures to wills have been procured under many
      pretexts by scoundrelly relatives and unscrupulous lawyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. And the witnesses have placed their signatures afterward,&rdquo;
       remarked The Sparrow thoughtfully. &ldquo;But in this case all seems above board&mdash;at
      least so far as the will is concerned. Benton was old Henfrey&rsquo;s bosom
      friend. Henfrey was very taken with Louise, and I know that he was
      desirous Hugh should marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he did, Hugh would acquire the old man&rsquo;s fortune, and Benton would
      step in and seize it&mdash;as is his intention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. All we can do is to keep Hugh and Louise apart. The latter
      is in entire ignorance of the true profession of her adopted father, and
      she&rsquo;d be horrified if she knew that Molly was simply a clever adventuress,
      who is very much wanted in Paris and in Brussels,&rdquo; said the gloved man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good job that she knows nothing,&rdquo; said Howell. &ldquo;But it would be a
      revelation to her if the police descended upon Shapley Manor&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That is why I must see Dorise Ranscomb and ascertain from her
      exactly what she has heard. I know the police tracked Hugh to London, and
      for that reason he went with Benton down into Surrey&mdash;out of the
      frying-pan into the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, before we can go farther, it seems that we should ascertain who
      shot Yvonne,&rdquo; Howell suggested. &ldquo;It was a most dastardly thing, and
      whoever did it ought to be punished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought. But I&rsquo;m as much in the dark as you are, Howell; but, as I have
      already said, I entertain strong suspicions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll suggest one name&mdash;Benton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The manservant, Giulio Cataldi?&rdquo; Howell ventured. &ldquo;I never liked that sly
      old Italian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What motive could the old fellow have had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robbery, probably. We have no idea what were Yvonne&rsquo;s winnings that night&mdash;or
      of the money she had in her bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we do know,&rdquo; was The Sparrow&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;According to the police
      report, Yvonne, on her return home, went to her room, carrying her bag,
      which she placed upon her dressing-table. Then, after removing her cloak
      and hat, she went downstairs again and out on to the veranda. A few
      minutes later the young man was announced. High words were heard by old
      Cataldi, and then a shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Yvonne&rsquo;s bag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was found where she had left it. In it were three thousand eight
      hundred francs, all in notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet Franklyn told me that he had heard how Yvonne won quite a large sum
      that night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might have done so&mdash;and have lost the greater part of it,&rdquo; The
      Sparrow replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the other hand, what more feasible than that the old manservant,
      watching her place it there, abstracted the bulk of the money&mdash;a
      large sum, no doubt&mdash;and afterwards, in order to conceal his crime,
      shot his mistress in such circumstances as to place the onus of the crime
      upon her midnight visitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the affair was very cleverly planned there is no doubt,&rdquo; said The
      Sparrow. &ldquo;There is a distinct intention to fasten the guilt upon young
      Henfrey, because he alone would have a motive for revenge for the death of
      his father. Of that fact the man or woman who fired the shot was most
      certainly aware. How could Cataldi have known of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly believe the Italian robbed his mistress and afterwards
      attempted to murder her,&rdquo; Howell insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might rob his mistress, certainly. He might even have robbed her of
      considerable sums systematically,&rdquo; The Sparrow assented. &ldquo;The maids told
      the police that Mademoiselle&rsquo;s habit was to leave her bag with her
      winnings upon the dressing-table while she went downstairs and took a
      glass of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. She did so every evening. Her habits were regular. Yet she never
      knew the extent of her winnings at the tables before she counted them. And
      she never did so until the following morning. That is what Franklyn told
      me in Venice when we met a month afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He learnt that from me,&rdquo; The Sparrow said with a smile. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he went on;
      &ldquo;though old Cataldi could well have robbed his mistress, just as the maids
      could have done, and Yvonne would have been none the wiser, yet I do not
      think he would attempt to conceal his crime by shooting her, because by so
      doing he cut off all future supplies. If he were a thief he would not be
      such a fool. Therefore you may rest assured, Howell, that the hand that
      fired the shot was that of some person who desired to close Yvonne&rsquo;s
      mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might have held some secret concerning old Cataldi. Or, on his part,
      he might have cherished some grievance against her. Italians are usually
      very vindictive,&rdquo; replied the visitor. &ldquo;On the other hand, it would be to
      Benton&rsquo;s advantage that the truth concerning old Henfrey&rsquo;s death was
      suppressed. Yvonne was about to tell the young man something&mdash;perhaps
      confess the truth, who knows?&mdash;when the shot was fired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Howell, you have your opinion and I have mine,&rdquo; laughed The
      Sparrow. &ldquo;The latter I shall keep to myself&mdash;until my theory is
      disproved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Howell took a cigar that his host offered him, and while he
      slowly lit it, The Sparrow crossed to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He quickly found Lady Ranscomb&rsquo;s number in the directory, and a few
      moments later was talking to the butler, of whom he inquired for Miss
      Dorise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that a friend of Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s wishes to speak to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments The Sparrow heard the girl&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;Who is speaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of Mr. Henfrey,&rdquo; was the reply of the man with the gloved hand.
      &ldquo;You will probably guess who it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard a little nervous laugh, and then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I&mdash;I have an idea, but I can&rsquo;t talk to you over the &lsquo;phone.
      I&rsquo;ve got somebody who&rsquo;s just called. Mother is out&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Then she lowered her voice, evidently not desirous of being heard in the
      adjoining room. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Does it concern Mr. Henfrey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It does. There&rsquo;s a man here to see me from Scotland Yard! What shall
      I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow gasped at the girl&rsquo;s announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next second he recovered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man from Scotland Yard!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Why has he called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows that Mr. Henfrey is living at Shapley, in Surrey. And he has
      been asking whether I am acquainted with you.&rdquo;

      TWENTY-THIRD CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHAT LISETTE KNEW
    </h3>
    <p>
      A fortnight had gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning in the Puerta del Sol, that great plaza in
      Madrid&mdash;the fine square which, like the similarly-named gates at
      Toledo and Segovia, commands a view of the rising sun, as does the ancient
      Temple of Abu Simbel on the Nile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey&mdash;a smart, lithe figure in blue serge&mdash;had been
      lounging for ten minutes before the long facade of the Ministerio de la
      Gobernacion (or Ministry of the Interior) smoking a cigarette and looking
      eagerly across the great square. The two soldiers on sentry at the door,
      suspicious of all foreigners in the days of Bolshevism and revolution, had
      eyed him narrowly. But he appeared to be inoffensive, so they had passed
      him by as a harmless lounger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later a smartly-dressed girl, with short skirt, silk
      stockings, and a pretty hat, came along the pavement, and Hugh sprang
      forward to greet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Lisette, the girl whom he had met when in hiding in that back
      street in Genoa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;So here we are! The Sparrow sent me to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I had a telegram from him four days ago ordering me to meet you.
      Strange things are happening&mdash;it seems!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked the young Englishman, in ignorance of the great conspiracy or
      of what was taking place. &ldquo;Since I saw you last, mademoiselle, I have been
      moving about rapidly, and always in danger of arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I. But I am here at The Sparrow&rsquo;s orders&mdash;on a little
      business which I hope to bring off successfully on any evening. I have an
      English friend with me&mdash;a Mr. Franklyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left London suddenly. I saw The Sparrow in the evening, and next
      morning, at eleven o&rsquo;clock, without even a bag, I left London for Madrid
      with a very useful passport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are here because Madrid is safer for you than London, I suppose?&rdquo;
       said the girl in broken English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so. A certain Mr. Howell, a friend of The Sparrow&rsquo;s suggested
      that I should come here,&rdquo; Hugh explained. &ldquo;Ever since we met in Italy I
      have been in close hiding until, by some means, my whereabouts became
      known, and I had to fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smartly-dressed girl walked slowly at his side and, for some moments,
      remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! So you have met Hamilton Shaw&mdash;alias Howell?&rdquo; she remarked at
      last in a changed voice. &ldquo;He certainly is not your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not my friend! Why? I&rsquo;ve only met him lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that the police knew of your hiding-place,&rdquo; said mademoiselle,
      speaking in French, as it was easier for her. &ldquo;Would you be surprised if
      Howell had revealed your secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howell!&rdquo; gasped Hugh. &ldquo;Yes, I certainly would. He is a close friend of
      The Sparrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be. But that does not prove that he is any friend of yours. If
      you came here at Howell&rsquo;s suggestion&mdash;then, Mr. Henfrey, I should
      advise you to leave Madrid at once. I say this because I have a suspicion
      that he intends both of us to fall into a trap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give you no explanation,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Now I know that Hamilton
      Shaw sent you here, I can, I think, discern his motive. I myself will see
      Mr. Franklyn at once, and shall leave Madrid as soon as possible. And I
      advise you, Mr. Henfrey, to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t suspect that it was this Mr. Howell who gave me away to
      Scotland Yard!&rdquo; exclaimed Hugh, surprised, but at the same time
      recollecting that The Sparrow had been alarmed at the detective&rsquo;s visit to
      Dorise. He knew that Benton and Mrs. Bond had suddenly disappeared from
      Shapley, but the reason he could only guess. He had, of course, no proof
      that Benton and Molly were members of the great criminal organization. He
      only knew that Benton had been his late father&rsquo;s closest friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      He discussed the situation with the girl jewel-thief as they walked along
      the busy Carrera de San Jeronimo wherein are the best shops in Madrid, to
      the great Plaza de Canovas in the leafy Prado.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he tried to extract from her what she knew concerning his father&rsquo;s
      death. But she would tell him nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not permitted to say anything, Mr. Henfrey. I can only regret it,&rdquo;
       she said quietly. &ldquo;Mr. Franklyn is at the Ritz opposite. I should like you
      to meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she took him across to the elegant hotel opposite the Neptune
      fountain, where, in a private sitting-room on the second floor, she
      introduced him to a rather elderly, aristocratic-looking Englishman, whom
      none would take to be one of the most expert jewel-thieves in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door was closed and they were alone, mademoiselle suddenly
      revealed to her friend what Hugh had said concerning Howell&rsquo;s suggestion
      that he should travel to Madrid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franklyn&rsquo;s face changed. He was instantly apprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we certainly are not safe here any longer. Howell probably intends
      to play us false! We shall know from The Sparrow the reason we are here,
      and, for aught we know, the police are watching and will arrest us
      red-handed. No,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we must leave this place&mdash;all three of us&mdash;as
      soon as possible. You, Lisette, had better go to Paris and explain matters
      to The Sparrow, while I shall fade away to Switzerland. And you, Mr.
      Henfrey? Where will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To France,&rdquo; was Hugh&rsquo;s reply, on the spur of the moment. &ldquo;I can get to
      Marseilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Go by way of Barcelona. It is quickest,&rdquo; said the Englishman. &ldquo;The
      express leaves just after three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, after he had thanked Hugh for his timely warning, the latter walked
      out more than ever mystified at the attitude of The Sparrow&rsquo;s accomplices.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem possible that Howell should have told Scotland Yard that
      he was hiding at Shapley; yet it was quite evident that both mademoiselle
      and her companion were equally in fear of the man Howell, whose real name
      was Hamilton Shaw. The theory seemed to him a thin one, for Howell was The
      Sparrow&rsquo;s intimate friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, mademoiselle, while they had been discussing the situation, had
      denounced him as their enemy, declaring that The Sparrow himself should be
      warned of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon Hugh, having only been in Madrid twelve hours, left again
      on the long, dusty railway journey across Spain to Zaragoza and down the
      valley of the Ebro to the Mediterranean. After crossing the French
      frontier, he broke the journey at the old-world town of Nimes for a couple
      of days, and then went on to Marseilles, where he took up his quarters in
      the big Louvre et Paix Hotel, still utterly mystified, and still not
      daring to write to Dorise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as well that he left Madrid, for, just as Lisette and Franklyn had
      suspected, the police called at his hotel&mdash;an obscure one near the
      station&mdash;only two hours after his departure. Then, finding him gone,
      they sought both mademoiselle and Franklyn, only to find that they also
      had fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Someone had given away their secret!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      On arrival at Marseilles in the evening Hugh ate his dinner alone in the
      hotel, and then strolled up the well-lit Cannebiere, with its many smart
      shops and gay cafes&mdash;that street which, to many thousands on their
      way to the Near or Far East, is their last glimpse of European life. He
      was entirely at a loose end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unnoticed behind him there walked an undersized little Frenchman, an
      alert, business-like man of about forty-five, who had awaited him outside
      his hotel, and who leisurely followed him up the broad, main street of
      that busy city.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was well-dressed, possessing a pair of shrewd, searching eyes, and a
      moustache carefully trimmed. His appearance was that of a prosperous
      French tradesman&mdash;one of thousands one meets in the city of
      Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Hugh idled along, gazing into some of the shop windows as he lazily
      smoked his cigarette, the under-sized stranger kept very careful watch
      upon his movements. He evidently intended that he should not escape
      observation. Hugh paused at a tobacconist&rsquo;s and bought some stamps, but as
      he came out of the shop, the watcher drew back suddenly and in such a
      manner as to reveal to anyone who might have observed him that he was no
      tyro in the art of surveillance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking a little farther along, Hugh came to the corner of the broad Rue
      de Rome, where he entered a crowded cafe in which an orchestra was
      playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken a corner seat in the window, had ordered his coffee, and was
      glancing at the <i>Petit Parisien</i>, which he had taken from his pocket,
      when another man entered, gazed around in search of a seat and, noticing
      one at Hugh&rsquo;s table, crossed, lifted his hat, and took the vacant chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the stranger who had followed him from the Louvre et Paix.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Englishman, all unsuspecting, glanced at the newcomer, and then
      resumed his paper, while the keen-eyed little man took a long, thin cigar
      which the waiter brought, lit it carefully, and sipped his coffee, his
      interest apparently centred in the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a tall, dark-haired woman, who had been sitting near by with a
      man who seemed to be her husband, rose and left. A moment before she had
      exchanged glances with the watcher, who, apparently at her bidding, rose
      and followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this seemed quite unnoticed by Hugh, immersed as he was in his
      newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the man and woman met. They held hurried consultation. The woman
      told him something which evidently caused him sudden surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will call on you at eleven to-morrow morning, madame,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I will meet you at the Reserve. I will lunch there at twelve. You
      will lunch with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;<i>Au revoir</i>,&rdquo; and he returned to his seat
      in the cafe, while she disappeared without returning to her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mysterious watcher resumed his coffee, for he had only been absent for
      a few moments, and the waiter had not cleared it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh took out his cigarette-case and, suddenly finding himself without a
      match, made the opportunity for which the mysterious stranger had been
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck one and handed it to his <i>vis-a-vis</i>, bowing with his
      foreign grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they naturally dropped into conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! m&rsquo;sieur is English!&rdquo; exclaimed the shrewd-eyed little man. &ldquo;Here, in
      Marseilles, we have many English who pass to and fro from the boats. I
      suppose, m&rsquo;sieur is going East?&rdquo; he suggested affably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hugh, speaking in French, &ldquo;I have some business here&mdash;that
      is all.&rdquo; He was highly suspicious of all strangers, and the more so of
      anyone who endeavoured to get into conversation with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Marseilles&mdash;of course?&rdquo; asked the stranger, sharply
      scrutinizing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been here several times before. I find the city always gay and
      bright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so bright as before the war,&rdquo; declared the little man, smoking at his
      ease. &ldquo;There have been many changes lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Henfrey could not make the fellow out. Yet many times before he had
      been addressed by strangers who seemed to question him out of curiosity,
      and for no apparent reason. This man was one of them, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, who had accompanied the woman whom the stranger had followed out,
      rose, exchanged a significant glance with the little man, and walked out.
      That the three were in accord seemed quite apparent, though Hugh was still
      unsuspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chatted merrily with the stranger for nearly half an hour, and then
      rose and left the cafe. When quite close to the hotel the stranger
      overtook him, and halting, asked in a low voice, in very good English:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are Mr. Henfrey&mdash;are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask that?&rdquo; inquired Hugh, much surprised. &ldquo;My name is Jordan&mdash;William
      Jordan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed the man. &ldquo;That is, I know, the name you have given at the
      hotel. But your real name is Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh started. The stranger, noticing his alarm, hastened to reassure him.

    <h2>
      TWENTY-FOURTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FRIEND OR ENEMY?
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not worry,&rdquo; said the stranger to Hugh. &ldquo;I am not your enemy, but
      a friend. I warn you that Marseilles is unsafe for you. Get away as soon
      as possible. The Spanish police have learnt that you have come here,&rdquo; he
      went on as he strolled at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh was amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know my identity?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was instructed to watch for your arrival&mdash;and to warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who instructed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of yours&mdash;and mine&mdash;The Sparrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He spoke to me on the telephone from Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were his instructions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you were to go at once&mdash;to-night&mdash;by car to the Hotel de
      Paris, at Cette. A car and driver awaits you at the Garage Beauvau, in the
      Rue Beauvau. I have arranged everything at The Sparrow&rsquo;s orders. You are
      one of Us, I understand,&rdquo; and the man laughed lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my bag?&rdquo; exclaimed Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the hotel, pay your bill, and take your bag to the station
      cloak-room. Then go and get the car, pick up your bag, and get out on the
      road to Cette as soon as ever you can. Your driver will ask no questions,
      and will remain silent. He has his orders from The Sparrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does The Sparrow ever come to Marseilles?&rdquo; Hugh asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sometimes&mdash;when anything really big brings him here. I have,
      however, only seen him once, five years ago. He was at your hotel, and the
      police were so hot upon his track that only by dint of great promptitude
      and courage he escaped by getting out of the window of his room and
      descending by means of the rain-water pipe. It was one of the narrowest
      escapes he has ever had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the words left the man&rsquo;s mouth, they were passing a well-lit brasserie.
      A tall, cadaverous man passed them and Hugh had a suspicion that they
      exchanged glances of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was his pretended friend an agent of the police?
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few seconds he debated within himself how he should act. To refuse
      to do as he was bid might be to bring instant arrest upon himself. If the
      stranger were actually a detective&mdash;which he certainly did not appear
      to be&mdash;then the ruse was to get him on the road to Cette because the
      legal formalities were not yet complete for his arrest as a British
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he knew all about The Sparrow, and his attitude was not in the least
      hostile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh could not make up his mind whether the stranger was an associate of
      the famous Sparrow, or whether he was very cleverly inveigling him into
      the net.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only that exchange of glances with the passer-by which had aroused
      Hugh&rsquo;s suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that significant look caused him to hesitate to accept the mysterious
      stranger as his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, he had accepted as friends numbers of other unknown persons since
      that fateful night at Monte Carlo. Yet in this case, he felt, by
      intuition, that all was not plain sailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, at last. &ldquo;I esteem it a very great favour that you
      should have interested yourself on behalf of one who is an entire stranger
      to you, and I heartily thank you for warning me of my danger. When I see
      The Sparrow I shall tell him how cleverly you approached me, and how
      perfect were your arrangements for my escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I require no thanks or reward, Mr. Henfrey,&rdquo; replied the man politely.
      &ldquo;My one desire is to get you safely out of Marseilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that the stranger lifted his hat and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh went about fifty yards farther along the broad, well-lit street full
      of life and movement, for the main streets of Marseilles are alive both
      day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      By some intuition&mdash;why, he knew not&mdash;he suspected that affable
      little man who had posed as his friend. Was it possible that, believing
      the notorious Sparrow to be his friend, he had at haphazard invented the
      story, and posed as one of The Sparrow&rsquo;s gang?
    </p>
    <p>
      If so, it was certainly a very clever and ingenious subterfuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was undecided how to act. He did not wish to give offence to his
      friend, the king of the underworld, and yet he felt a distinct suspicion
      of the man who had so cleverly approached him, and who had openly declared
      himself to be a crook.
    </p>
    <p>
      That strange glance he had exchanged with the passer-by beneath the rays
      of the street-lamp had been mysterious and significant. If the passer-by
      had been a crook, like himself, the sign of recognition would be one of
      salutation. But the expression upon his alleged friend&rsquo;s face was one of
      triumph. That made all the difference, and to Hugh, with his observation
      quickened as it had been in those months of living with daily dread of
      arrest, it had caused him to be seized with strong and distinct
      suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt in his hip pocket and found that his revolver, an American
      Smith-Wesson, was there. He had a dislike of automatic pistols, as he had
      once had a very narrow escape. He had been teaching a girl to shoot with a
      revolver, when, believing that she had discharged the whole magazine, he
      was examining the weapon and pulled the trigger, narrowly escaping
      shooting her dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few seconds he stood upon the broad pavement. Then he drew out his
      cigarette-case. In it were four cigarettes, two of which The Sparrow had
      given him when in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Somebody must have given me away at
      Shapley, and now they have followed me! I will act for myself, and take
      the risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he walked boldly on, crossed the road, and entered the big Hotel de
      Louvre et Paix. To appear unconcerned he had a drink at the bar, and
      ascending in the lift, called the floor-waiter, asked for his bill, and
      packed his bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;If I could only get to know where The Sparrow
      is and ask him the truth! He may be at that address in Paris which he gave
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little delay the bill was brought and he paid it. Then in a taxi
      he drove to the station where he deposited his bag in the cloak-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close by the <i>consigne</i> a woman was standing. He glanced at her,
      when, to his surprise, he saw that she was the same woman who had been
      sitting in the cafe with a male companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she, he wondered, in league with his so-called friend? And if so, what
      was intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sight of that woman lounging there, however, decided him. She was, no
      doubt, awaiting his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked out of the great railway terminus, and, inquiring the way to the
      Rue Beauvau, soon found the garage where a powerful open car was awaiting
      him in the roadway outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smart driver in a dark overcoat came forward, and apparently recognizing
      Hugh from a description that had been given to him, touched his cap, and
      asked in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does m&rsquo;sieur wish to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the station to fetch my coat and bag,&rdquo; replied the young Englishman,
      peering into the driver&rsquo;s face. He was a clean-shaven man of about forty,
      broad-shouldered and stalwart. Was it possible that the car had been hired
      by the police, and the driver was himself a police agent?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; the man answered politely. And Hugh having entered,
      he drove up the Boulevard de la Liberte to the Gare St. Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the <i>consigne</i>, he looked along the platform, and
      there, sure enough, was the same woman on the watch, though she pretended
      to be without the slightest interest in his movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh put on his coat, and, carrying his bag, placed it in the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have your orders?&rdquo; asked Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, m&rsquo;sieur. We are to go to Cette with all speed. Is not that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was Hugh&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;I will come up beside you. I prefer it. We shall
      have a long, dark ride to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but the roads are good,&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;I came from Cette
      yesterday,&rdquo; he added, as he mounted to his seat and the passenger got up
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh sat there very thoughtful as the car sped out of the city of noise
      and bustle. The man&rsquo;s remark that he had come from Cette on the previous
      day gave colour to the idea that no net had been spread, but that the
      stranger was acting at the orders of the ubiquitous Sparrow. Indeed, were
      it not for the strange glance the undersized little man had given to the
      passer-by, he would have been convinced that he was actually once again
      under the protection of the all-powerful ruler of the criminal underworld.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, he remained suspicious. He did not like that woman who had
      watched so patiently his coming and going at the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      With strong headlights glaring&mdash;for the night was extremely dark and
      a strong wind was blowing&mdash;they were soon out on the broad highway
      which leads first across the plain and then beside the sea, and again
      across the lowlands to old-world Arles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight before they got to the village of Lancon, an obscure
      little place in total darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the way the driver, who had told Hugh that his name was Henri
      Aramon, and who insinuated that he was one of The Sparrow&rsquo;s associates,
      became most affable and talkative. Over those miles of dark roads,
      unfamiliar to Hugh, they travelled at high speed, for Henri had from the
      first showed himself to be an expert driver, not only in the unceasing
      traffic of the main streets of Marseilles, but also on the dark, much-worn
      roads leading out of the city. The roads around Marseilles have never been
      outstanding for their excellence, and after the war they were indeed
      execrable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Lancon,&rdquo; the driver remarked, as they sped through the dark
      little town. &ldquo;We now go on to Salon, where we have a direct road across
      the plain they call the Crau into Arles. From there the road to Cette is
      quite good and straight. The road we are now on is the worst,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh was undecided. Was the man who was driving him so rapidly out of the
      danger zone his friend&mdash;or his enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat there for over an hour unable to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an outlandish part of France,&rdquo; he remarked to the driver
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But after Salon it is more desolate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is there no railway near?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After Salon, yes. It runs parallel with the road about two miles to the
      north&mdash;the railway between Arles and Aix-en-Provence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So if we get a breakdown, which I hope we shall not, we are not far from
      a railway?&rdquo; Hugh remarked, as through the night the heavy car tore along
      that open desolate road.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat there he thought of Dorise, wondering what had happened&mdash;and
      of Louise. If he had obeyed his father&rsquo;s wishes and married the latter all
      the trouble would have been avoided, he thought. Yet he loved Dorise&mdash;loved
      her with his whole soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she doubted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor fellow! Hustled from pillar to post, and compelled to resort to every
      ruse in order to avoid arrest for a crime which he did not commit, yet
      about which he could not establish his innocence, he very often despaired.
      At that moment he felt somehow&mdash;how he could not explain&mdash;that
      he was in a very tight corner. He felt confident after two hours of
      reflection that he was being driven over these roads that night in order
      that the police should gain time to execute some legal formality for his
      arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had not the police of Marseilles arrested him? There was some subtle
      motive for sending him to Cette.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not had time to send a telegram to Mr. Peters in London, or to
      Monsieur Gautier, the name by which The Sparrow told him he was known at
      his flat in the Rue des Petits Champs, in the centre of Paris. He longed
      to be able to communicate with his all-powerful friend, but there had been
      no opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the car began to pass through banks of mist, which are usual at
      night over the low marshes around the mouths of the Rhone. It was about
      half-past two in the morning. They had passed through the long dark
      streets of Salon, and were already five or six miles on the broad straight
      road which runs across the marshes through St. Martin-de-Crau into Arles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden Hugh declared that he must have a cigarette, and producing his
      case handed one to the driver and took one himself. Then he lit the man&rsquo;s,
      and afterwards his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is cold here on the marshes, monsieur,&rdquo; remarked the driver, his
      cigarette between his lips. &ldquo;This mist, too, is puzzling. But it is nearly
      always like this at night. That is why nobody lives about here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it quite deserted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, except for a few shepherds, and they live up north at the foot of
      the hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some ten minutes or so they kept on, but Hugh had suddenly become very
      watchful of the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the man exclaimed in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not feel very well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Hugh in alarm. &ldquo;You must not be taken ill here&mdash;so
      far from anywhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the man was evidently unwell, for he pulled up the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my head!&rdquo; he cried, putting both hands to his brow as the cigarette
      dropped from his lips. &ldquo;My head! It seems as if it will burst! And&mdash;and
      I can&rsquo;t see! Everything is going round&mdash;round! Where&mdash;<i>where
      am I</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all right, my friend. Get into the back of the car and rest. You
      will be yourself very quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he half dragged the man from his seat and placed him in the back of
      the car, where he fell inert and unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cigarette which The Sparrow had given to Hugh only to be used in case
      of urgent necessity had certainly done its work. The man, whether friend
      or enemy, would now remain unconscious for many hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh, having settled him in the bottom of the car, placed a rug over him.
      Then, mounting to the driver&rsquo;s place, he turned the car and drove as
      rapidly as he dared back over the roads to Salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time after time, he wondered whether he had been misled; whether, after
      all, the man who had driven him was actually acting under The Sparrow&rsquo;s
      orders. If so, then he had committed a fatal error!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the die was cast. He had acted upon his own initiative, and if a
      net had actually been spread to catch him he had successfully broken
      through it. He laughed as he thought of the police at Cette awaiting his
      arrival, and their consternation when hour after hour passed without news
      of the car from Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Salon he passed half way through the town to cross roads where he had
      noticed in passing a sign-board which indicated the road to Avignon&mdash;the
      broad high road from Marseilles to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already he had made up his mind how to act. He would get to Avignon, and
      thence by express to Paris. The <i>rapides</i> from Marseilles and the
      Riviera all stopped at the ancient city of the Popes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, being a good motor driver, Hugh started away down the long road
      which led through the valley to Orgon, and thence direct to Avignon, which
      came into sight about seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before entering the old city of walls and castles Hugh turned into a side
      road about two miles distant, drove the car to the end, and opening a gate
      succeeded in getting it some little distance into a wood, where it was
      well concealed from anyone passing along the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, descending and ascertaining that the driver was sleeping comfortably
      from the effects of the strong narcotic, he took his bag and walked into
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the railway station he found the through express from Ventimiglia&mdash;the
      Italian frontier&mdash;to Paris would be due in twenty minutes, therefore
      he purchased a first-class ticket for Paris, and in a short time was
      taking his morning coffee in the <i>wagon-restaurant</i> on his way to the
      French capital.

      TWENTY-FIFTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MAN CATALDI
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the day that Hugh was travelling in hot haste to Paris, Charles Benton
      arrived in Nice early in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the station it was apparent he knew his way about the town, for
      passing down the Avenue de la Gare, with its row of high eucalyptus trees,
      to the Place Massena, he plunged into the narrow, rather evil-smelling
      streets of the old quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before a house in the Rue Rossette he paused, and ascending to a flat on
      the third floor, rang the bell. The door was slowly opened by an elderly,
      rather shabbily-attired Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Yvonne&rsquo;s late servant at the Villa Amette, Giulio Cataldi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man drew back on recognizing his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cataldi!&rdquo; exclaimed the well-dressed adventurer cheerily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      quite a stranger&mdash;am I not? I was in Nice, and I could not leave
      without calling to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man, with ill-grace scarcely concealed, invited him into his
      shabby room, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Signor Benton, I never thought to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you didn&rsquo;t want to&mdash;eh? After that little affair in
      Brussels. But I assure you it was not my fault. Mademoiselle Yvonne made
      the blunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nearly let us all into the hands of the police&mdash;including The
      Sparrow himself!&rdquo; growled the old fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! But all that has long blown over. Now,&rdquo; he went on, after he had
      offered the old man a cigar. &ldquo;Now the real reason I&rsquo;ve called is to ask
      you about this nasty affair concerning Mademoiselle Yvonne. You were there
      that night. What do you know about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; the old fellow declared promptly. &ldquo;Since that night I&rsquo;ve earned
      an honest living. I&rsquo;m a waiter in a cafe in the Avenue de la Gare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most excellent decision,&rdquo; laughed the well-dressed man. &ldquo;It is not
      everyone who can afford to be honest in these hard times. I wish I could
      be, but I find it impossible. Now, tell me, Giulio, what do you know about
      the affair at the Villa Amette? The boy, Henfrey, went there to demand of
      Mademoiselle how his father died. She refused to tell him, angry words
      arose&mdash;and he shot her. Now, isn&rsquo;t that your theory&mdash;the same as
      that held by the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked straight into his visitor&rsquo;s face for a few moments.
      Then he replied quite calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing, Signor Benton&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t want to know anything.
      I&rsquo;ve told the police all I know. Indeed, when they began to inquire into
      my antecedents I was not very reassured, I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; laughed Benton. &ldquo;Still, they never suspected you to
      be the man wanted for the Morel affair&mdash;an unfortunate matter that
      was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed the old fellow. &ldquo;Please do not mention it,&rdquo; and he turned
      away to the window as though to conceal his guilty countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you <i>know</i> something&mdash;but you won&rsquo;t tell it!&rdquo;
       Benton said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; was the old fellow&rsquo;s stubborn reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know that the young fellow, Henfrey, is guilty!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Benton. &ldquo;Come! you were there at the time! You heard high words between
      them&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already made my statement to the police,&rdquo; declared the old
      Italian. &ldquo;What else I know I shall keep to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m interested in ascertaining whether Henfrey is innocent or guilty.
      Only two persons can tell us that&mdash;Mademoiselle, who is, alas! in a
      hopeless mental state, and yourself. You know&mdash;but you refuse to
      incriminate the guilty person. Why don&rsquo;t you tell the truth? You know that
      Henfrey shot her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I know nothing,&rdquo; retorted the old man. &ldquo;Why do you come here
      and disturb me?&rdquo; he added peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want to know the truth,&rdquo; Benton answered. &ldquo;And I mean to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; snapped the wilful old fellow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done with you all&mdash;all
      the crowd of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; laughed Benton. &ldquo;Then you forget the little matter of the man Morel&mdash;eh?
      That is not forgotten by the police, remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you said a word to them, Signor Benton, then you would implicate
      yourself,&rdquo; the old man growled. Seeing hostility in the Englishman&rsquo;s
      attitude he instantly resented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably. But as I have no intention of giving you away, my dear Giulio,
      I do not think we need discuss it. What I am anxious to do is to establish
      the guilt&mdash;or the innocence&mdash;of Hugh Henfrey,&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. You have reason for establishing his guilt&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Reasons for establishing his innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your own ends, Signor Benton,&rdquo; was the shrewd old man&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At one time there was a suspicion that you yourself had fired at
      Mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; gasped the old man, his countenance changing instantly. &ldquo;Who says
      that?&rdquo; he asked angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police were suspicious, I believe. And as far as I can gather they
      are not yet altogether satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; growled the old Italian in a changed voice. &ldquo;They will have to prove
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they declare that the shot was fired by either one or the other of
      you,&rdquo; Benton said, much surprised at the curious effect the allegation had
      upon the old fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they think that if the Signorino Henfrey is innocent I am guilty of
      the murderous attack&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benton nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are seeking to arrest the signorino!&rdquo; remarked the Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That is why I am here&mdash;to establish his innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I were to tell you that he was innocent I should condemn myself!&rdquo;
       laughed the crafty old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Giulio,&rdquo; said Benton. &ldquo;I confess that I have long ago
      regretted the shabby manner in which I treated you when we were all in
      Brussels, and I hope you will allow me to make some little amend.&rdquo; Then,
      taking from his pocket-book several hundred-franc notes, he doubled them
      up and placed them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;I see! You want to <i>buy</i> my secret! No, take
      your money!&rdquo; he cried, pushing it back towards him contemptuously. &ldquo;I want
      none of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are now earning an honest living,&rdquo; Benton sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and Il Passero knows it!&rdquo; was Cataldi&rsquo;s bold reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you refuse to tell me anything you know concerning the events of
      that night at the Villa Amette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Take your money, and leave me in peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have come all the way from England to see you,&rdquo; remarked the
      disappointed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be extremely careful. You have enemies, so have I. They are the same as
      those who denounced the signorino to the police&mdash;as they will no
      doubt, before long, denounce you!&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! You always were a pessimist, Giulio,&rdquo; Benton laughed. &ldquo;I do not fear
      any enemies&mdash;I assure you. The Sparrow takes good care that we are
      prevented from falling into any traps the police may set,&rdquo; he added after
      a moment&rsquo;s pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old waiter shook his head dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day there may be a slip&mdash;and it will cost you all very dearly,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in a bad mood, Giulio&mdash;like all those who exist by being
      honest,&rdquo; Benton laughed, though he was extremely annoyed at his failure to
      learn anything from the old fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that the suspicions which both Molly and he had
      entertained were true&mdash;namely, that the old man had attempted to kill
      his mistress? After all, the hue-and-cry had been raised by the police
      merely because Hugh Henfrey had fled and successfully escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benton, after grumbling because the old man would make no statement, and
      again hinting at the fact that he might be the culprit, left with very ill
      grace, his long journey from London having been in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Henfrey was to be free to marry Louise, then his innocence must first
      be proved. Charles Benton had for many weeks realized that his chance of
      securing old Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s great fortune was slowly slipping from him.
      Once Hugh had married Louise and settled the money upon her, then the rest
      would be easy. He had many times discussed it with Molly, and they were
      both agreed upon a vile, despicable plot which would result in the young
      man&rsquo;s sudden end and the diversion of his father&rsquo;s fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole plot against old Mr. Henfrey was truly one of the most elaborate
      and amazing ones ever conceived by criminal minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Benton was a little too well known in Nice, hence he took care to
      leave the place by an early train, and went on to Cannes, where he was a
      little less known. As an international crook he had spent several seasons
      at Nice and Monte Carlo, but had seldom gone to Cannes, as it was too
      aristocratic and too slow for an <i>escroc</i> like himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Cannes he put up at the Hotel Beau Site, and that night ate an
      expensive dinner in the restaurant at the Casino. Then, next day, he took
      the <i>train-de-luxe</i> direct for Calais, and went on to London, all
      unconscious of the sensational events which were then happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arrival in London he found a telegram lying upon his table among some
      letters. It was signed &ldquo;Shaw,&rdquo; and urged him to meet him &ldquo;at the usual
      place&rdquo; at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening. &ldquo;I know you are away, but I&rsquo;ll
      look in each night at seven,&rdquo; it concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just six o&rsquo;clock, therefore Benton washed and changed, and just
      before seven o&rsquo;clock entered a little cafe off Wardour Street, patronized
      mostly by foreigners. At one of the tables, sitting alone, was a
      wiry-looking, middle-aged man&mdash;Mr. Howell, The Sparrow&rsquo;s friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Howell, when a few minutes later they were walking along
      Wardour Street together. &ldquo;How did you get on in Nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had my journey for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t the old man tell anything?&rdquo; asked Howell eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; Benton replied. &ldquo;But my firm opinion is that he himself
      tried to kill Yvonne&mdash;that he shot her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really agree with me?&rdquo; gasped Howell excitedly. &ldquo;Of course, there
      has, all along, been a certain amount of suspicion against him. The police
      were once on the point of arresting him. I happen to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my belief is that young Henfrey is innocent. I never thought so
      until now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must prove Cataldi guilty, and Henfrey can marry Louise,&rdquo; Howell
      said. &ldquo;But the reason I wanted to get in touch with you is that the police
      went to Shapley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Shapley!&rdquo; gasped Benton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They went there the night you left London. Evidently somebody has
      given you away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given me away! Who in the devil&rsquo;s name can it be? If I get to know who
      the traitor is I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;by gad, I&rsquo;ll kill him. I swear I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows? Some secret enemy of yours&mdash;no doubt. Molly has been
      arrested and has been up at Bow Street. They also arrested Louise, but
      there being no charge against her, she has been released. I&rsquo;ve sent her up
      to Cambridge&mdash;to old Mrs. Curtis. I thought she&rsquo;d be quite quiet and
      safe there for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Molly arrested! What&rsquo;s the charge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theft. An extradition warrant from Paris. That jeweller&rsquo;s affair in the
      Rue St. Honore, eighteen months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope they won&rsquo;t bring forward other charges, or it will go
      infernally bad with her. What has The Sparrow done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s abroad somewhere&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve had five hundred pounds from an
      unknown source to pay for her defence. I saw the solicitors. Brigthorne,
      the well-known barrister, appeared for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this is very serious, my dear Howell,&rdquo; Benton declared, much
      alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. You can&rsquo;t marry the girl to young Henfrey until he is
      proved innocent, and that cannot be until the guilt is fixed upon the
      crafty old Giulio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. That&rsquo;s what we must do. But with Molly arrested we shall be
      compelled to be very careful,&rdquo; said Benton, as they turned toward
      Piccadilly Circus. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we dare move until Molly is either
      free or convicted. If she knew our game she might give us away. Remember
      that if we bring off the Henfrey affair Molly has to have a share in the
      spoils. But if she happens to be in a French prison she won&rsquo;t get much
      chance&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she goes it will be ten years, without a doubt,&rdquo; Howell remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And in the meantime much can happen&mdash;eh?&rdquo; laughed Benton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots. But one reassuring fact is that, as far as old Henfrey&rsquo;s fate is
      concerned, Mademoiselle&rsquo;s lips are closed. Whoever shot her did us a very
      good turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But I agree we must fix the guilt upon old Cataldi. He almost
      as good as admitted it by his face when I taxed him with it. Why not give
      him away to the Nice police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet. Certainly not,&rdquo; exclaimed Howell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity The Sparrow does not know about the Henfrey business. He
      might help us. Dare we tell him? What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him! Good Heavens! No! Surely you are fully aware how he always sets
      his face against any attempt upon human life, and no one who has taken
      life has ever had his forgiveness,&rdquo; said Howell. &ldquo;The Sparrow is our
      master&mdash;a fine and marvellous mind which has no equal in Europe. If
      he had gone into politics he could have been the greatest statesman of the
      age. But he is Il Passero, the man who directs affairs of every kind, and
      the man at the helm of every great enterprise. Yet his one fixed motto is
      that life shall not be taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in old Henfrey&rsquo;s case we acted upon our own initiative,&rdquo; remarked
      Benton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Yours was a wonderfully well-conceived idea. And all worked without
      a hitch until young Henfrey&rsquo;s visit to Monte Carlo, and his affection for
      that girl Ranscomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are weaning him away from her,&rdquo; Benton said. &ldquo;At last the girl&rsquo;s
      suspicions are excited, and there is just that little disagreement which,
      broadening, leads to the open breach. Oh! my dear Howell, how could you
      and I live if it were not for that silly infection called love? In our
      profession love is all-conquering. Without it we could make no progress,
      no smart coups, no conquests of women who afterwards shed out to us money
      which at the assizes they would designate by the ugly word &lsquo;blackmail.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Charles. You were always a philosopher,&rdquo; laughed his companion&mdash;the
      man who was a bosom friend of The Sparrow. &ldquo;But it carries us no nearer.
      We must, at all costs, fix the hand that shot Yvonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giulio shot her&mdash;without a doubt!&rdquo; was Benton&rsquo;s quick reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing together on the kerb outside the Tube station at
      Piccadilly Circus as Benton uttered the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, then let us prove it,&rdquo; said Howell. &ldquo;But not yet,
      remember. We must first see how it goes with Molly. She must be watched
      carefully. Of course, I agree that Giulio Cataldi shot Yvonne. Later we
      will prove that fact, but the worst of it is that the French police are
      hot on the track of young Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; asked his companion quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, after a second&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;I heard so two days
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Howell, pleading an urgent meeting with a mutual friend, also a crook
      like themselves, grasped the other&rsquo;s hand, and they parted.

    <h2>
      TWENTY-SIXTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LISETTE&rsquo;S DISCLOSURES
    </h3>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock on the morning that Hugh Henfrey left Avignon for Paris,
      The Sparrow stood at the window of his cozy little flat in the Rue des
      Petits Champs, where he was known to his elderly housekeeper&mdash;a
      worthy old soul from Yvetot, in the north&mdash;as Guillaume Gautier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was one of those great old ones built in the days of the First
      Empire, with a narrow entrance and square courtyard into which the stage
      coaches with postilions rumbled before the days of the P.L.M. and
      aircraft. In the Napoleonic days it had been the residence of the Dukes de
      Vizelle, but in modern times it had been converted into a series of very
      commodious flats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow, sprightly and alert, stood, after taking his <i>cafe au lait</i>,
      looking down into the courtyard. He had been reading through several
      letters and telegrams which had caused him some perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are playing me false!&rdquo; he muttered, as he gazed out of the window.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain of it&mdash;quite certain! But, Gad! If they do I&rsquo;ll be even
      with them! Who could have given Henfrey away in London&mdash;<i>and why</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paced the length of the room, his teeth hard set and his hands
      clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought they were all loyal after what I have done for them&mdash;after
      the fortunes I have put into their pockets. Fancy! One of them a
      well-known member of Parliament&mdash;another a director of one of the
      soundest insurance companies! Nobody suspects the really great crooks. It
      is only the little clumsy muddlers whom the police catch and the judge
      makes examples of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then crossing back to the window, he said aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisette ought to be here! She was due in from Toulouse at nine o&rsquo;clock. I
      hope nothing further has happened. One thing is satisfactory&mdash;young
      Henfrey is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, the girl had spoken to The Sparrow from her hotel in
      Toulouse late on the previous night, and told him that her &ldquo;friend Hugh&rdquo;
       was in Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to the master criminal the whole problem was increasingly
      complicated. He could not prove the innocence of young Henfrey, because of
      the mysterious, sinister influence being brought to bear against him. He
      had interested himself in aiding the young fellow to evade arrest, because
      he had no desire that there should be a trial in which he and his
      associates might be implicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow hated trials of any sort. With him silence was golden, and
      very wisely he would pay any sum rather than court publicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour went past, but the girl he expected did not put in an
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Gautier&mdash;the man with the gloved hand&mdash;was believed by
      his old housekeeper to be a rich and somewhat eccentric bachelor, who was
      interested in old clocks and antique silver, and who travelled extensively
      in order to purchase fine specimens. Indeed it was by that description he
      was registered in the archives of the Surete, with the observation that
      notwithstanding his foreign name he was an Englishman of highest standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was never dreamed that the bristly-haired alert little man, who was so
      often seen in the salerooms of Paris when antique silver was being sold,
      was the notorious Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisette&rsquo;s failure to arrive considerably disturbed him. He hoped that
      nothing had happened to her. Time after time, he walked to the window and
      looked out eagerly for her to cross the courtyard. In those rooms he
      sometimes lived for weeks in safe obscurity, his neighbours regarding him
      as a man of the greatest integrity, though a trifle eccentric in his
      habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, just before eleven, he saw Lisette&rsquo;s smart figure in a heavy
      travelling coat crossing the courtyard, and a few moments later she was
      shown into his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re late!&rdquo; the old man said, as soon as the door was closed. &ldquo;I feared
      that something had gone wrong! Why did you leave Madrid? What has
      happened?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happened!&rdquo; she echoed in French. &ldquo;Why, very nearly a disaster! Someone
      has given us away&mdash;at least, Monsieur Henfrey was given away to the
      police!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not arrested?&rdquo; he asked breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We all three managed to get away&mdash;but only just in time! I had a
      wire to-night from Monsieur Tresham, telling me guardedly that within an
      hour or so after we left Madrid the police called at my hotel&mdash;and at
      Henfrey&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can have done that?&rdquo; asked The Sparrow, his eyes narrowing in anger,
      his gloved hand clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your enemy&mdash;and mine!&rdquo; was the girl&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;Franklyn is in
      Switzerland. Monsieur Henfrey is in Marseilles&mdash;at the Louvre et Paix&mdash;and
      I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we have a secret enemy&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and he is not very far to seek. Monsieur Howell has done this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howell! He would never do such a thing, my dear mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied
      the gloved man, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! wouldn&rsquo;t he? I would not trust either Benton or Howell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are mistaken, mademoiselle. They have never shown much
      friendship towards each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are close friends as far as concerns the Henfrey affair,&rdquo; declared
      mademoiselle. &ldquo;I happen to know that it was Howell who prepared the old
      man&rsquo;s will. It is in his handwriting, and his manservant, Cooke, is one of
      the witnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? <i>You know about that will, Lisette?</i> Tell me everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howell himself let it out to me. They were careful that you should not
      know. At the time I was in London with Franklyn and Benton over the jewels
      of that ship-owner&rsquo;s wife, I forget her name&mdash;the affair in Carlton
      House Terrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I recollect. A very neat piece of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;Howell told me how he had prepared the will, and how Benton,
      who was staying with old Mr. Henfrey away in the country, got him to put
      his signature to it by pretending it to be for the purchase of a house at
      Eltham, in Kent. The house was, indeed, purchased at Benton&rsquo;s suggestion,
      but the signature was to a will which Howell&rsquo;s man, Cooke, and a friend of
      his, named Saunders, afterwards witnessed, and which has now been proved&mdash;the
      will by which the young man is compelled to marry Benton&rsquo;s adopted
      daughter before he inherits his father&rsquo;s estates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You actually know this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howell told me so with his own lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why is young Henfrey being made the victim?&rdquo; asked The Sparrow
      shrewdly. &ldquo;Why, indeed, have you not revealed this to me before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I had no proof before that Howell is <i>our</i> enemy. He has now
      given us away. He has some motive. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bristly-haired little man of twenty names and as many individualities
      pondered for a moment. It was evident that he was both apprehensive and
      amazed at the suggestion the pretty young French girl had placed before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When one finds a betrayer, then in order to fix his guilt it becomes
      necessary to discover the motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow was in a quandary. Seldom was he in such a perturbed state of
      mind. He and his accomplices could always defy the police. It was not the
      first time in his career, however, that he had found a traitor in his
      camp. If Howell was really a traitor, then he would pay dearly for it.
      Three times within the last ten years there had been traitors in the great
      criminal organization. One was a Dutchman; the second was a Greek; and the
      third a Swiss. Each died&mdash;for dead men tell no tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow ordered some <i>cafe noir</i> from his housekeeper and
      produced a particularly seductive brand of liqueur, which mademoiselle
      took&mdash;together with a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she left, he giving her the parting injunction:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is probable that you will go to Marseilles and meet young Henfrey. I
      will think it all over. You will have a note from me at the Grand Hotel
      before noon to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      TWENTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE INQUISITIVE MR. SHRIMPTON
    </h3>
    <p>
      An hour later Hugh stood in The Sparrow&rsquo;s room, and related his exciting
      adventure in Marseilles and on the high road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; remarked the man with the gloved hand. &ldquo;A very pretty piece of
      business. The police endeavoured to mislead you, and you, by a very
      fortunate circumstance, suspected. That cigarette, my dear young friend,
      stood you in very good stead. It was fortunate that I gave it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time the driver of the car has, of course, recovered and told his
      story,&rdquo; Hugh remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by this time the police probably know that you have come to Paris,&rdquo;
       remarked The Sparrow. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Henfrey, only an hour ago I learnt
      something which has altered my plans entirely. There is a traitor
      somewhere&mdash;somebody has given you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present I have not decided. But we must all be wary and watchful,&rdquo; was
      The Sparrow&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;In any case, it is a happy circumstance that you saw
      through the ruse of the police to get you to Cette. First the Madrid
      police were put upon your track, and then, as you eluded them, the
      Marseilles police were given timely information&mdash;a clever trap,&rdquo; he
      laughed. &ldquo;I admire it. But at Marseilles they are even more shrewd than in
      Paris. Maillot, the <i>chef de la Surete</i> at Marseilles, is a really
      capable official. I know him well. A year ago he dined with me at the
      Palais de la Bouillabaisse. I pretended that I had been the victim of a
      great theft, and he accepted my invitation. He little dreamed that I was
      Il Passero, for whom he had been spreading the net for years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really marvellous, Mr. Peters,&rdquo; remarked Hugh. &ldquo;And I have to
      thank you for the way in which you have protected me time after time. Your
      organization is simply wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man with the black glove laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing really wonderful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Those who are innocent I protect,
      those who are traitors I condemn. And they never escape me. We have
      traitors at work now. It is for me to fix the identity. And in this you,
      Mr. Henfrey, must help me. Have you heard from Miss Ranscomb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not a word,&rdquo; replied the young man. &ldquo;I dare not write to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t. A man from Scotland Yard went to see her. So it is best to
      remain apart&mdash;my dear boy&mdash;even though that unfortunate
      misunderstanding concerning Louise Lambert has arisen between you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am anxious to put it right,&rdquo; the young fellow said. &ldquo;Dorise
      misjudges me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I know. But at present you must allow her to think ill of you. You
      must not court arrest. We now know that you have enemies who intend you to
      be the victim, while they reap the profit,&rdquo; said The Sparrow kindly.
      &ldquo;Leave matters to me and act at my suggestion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I certainly will,&rdquo; Hugh replied. &ldquo;You have never yet advised me
      wrongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I am not infallible,&rdquo; laughed the master criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose, and crossing to the telephone, he inquired for the Grand
      Hotel. After a few minutes he spoke to Mademoiselle Lisette, telling her
      that she need not go to Marseilles, and asking her to call upon him again
      at nine o&rsquo;clock that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Hugh has returned from the south,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;He is anxious to
      see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tres bien, m&rsquo;sieur</i>,&rdquo; answered the smart Parisienne. &ldquo;I will be
      there. But will you not dine with me&mdash;eh? At Vian&rsquo;s at seven. You
      know the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Lisette asks us to dine with her at Vian&rsquo;s,&rdquo; The Sparrow
      said, turning to Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall be delighted,&rdquo; replied the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      So The Sparrow accepted the girl&rsquo;s invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that same morning, Dorise Ranscomb had, after breakfast, settled
      herself to write some letters. Her mother had gone to Warwickshire for the
      week-end, and she was alone with the maids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole matter concerning Hugh puzzled her. She could not bring herself
      to a decision as to his innocence or his guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat writing in the morning-room, the maid announced that Mr.
      Shrimpton wished to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started at the name. It was the detective inspector from Scotland Yard
      who had called upon her on a previous occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments afterwards he was shown in, a tall figure in a rough tweed
      suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really must apologize, Miss Ranscomb, for disturbing you, but I have
      heard news of Mr. Henfrey. He has been in Marseilles. Have you heard from
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; the girl replied. &ldquo;And, Mr. Shrimpton, I am growing very
      concerned. I really can&rsquo;t think that he tried to kill the young
      Frenchwoman. Why should he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, because she had connived at his father&rsquo;s death. That seems to be
      proved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your theory is that it was an act of vengeance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, Miss Ranscomb. That is our opinion, and a warrant being out for
      his arrest both in France and in England, we are doing all we can to get
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you certain?&rdquo; asked the girl, much distressed. &ldquo;After all, though
      on the face of things it seems that there is a distinct motive, I do not
      think that Hugh would be guilty of such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. Forgive me for saying so, miss, but I quite appreciate your
      point of view. If I were in your place I should regard the matter in just
      the same light. I, however, wondered whether you had heard news of him
      during the last day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have heard nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose if you did hear, you would not tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my own affair, Mr. Shrimpton,&rdquo; she replied resentfully. &ldquo;If you
      desire to arrest Mr. Henfrey it is your own affair. Why do you ask me to
      assist you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the interests of justice,&rdquo; was the inspector&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the girl, very promptly, &ldquo;I tell you at once that I refuse to
      assist you in your endeavour to arrest Mr. Henfrey. Whether he is guilty
      or not guilty I have not yet decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he must be guilty. There was the motive. He shot the woman who had
      enticed his father to his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how have you ascertained that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By logical deduction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are trying to convict Mr. Henfrey upon circumstantial evidence
      alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Others have gone to the gallows on circumstantial evidence&mdash;Crippen,
      for instance. There was no actual witness of his crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I must allow you to continue your investigations, Mr. Shrimpton,&rdquo;
       she said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your lover has deceived you. He was staying down in Surrey with the
      girl, Miss Lambert, as his fellow-guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; was Dorise&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;But I have since come to the
      conclusion that my surmise&mdash;my jealousy if you like to call it so&mdash;is
      unfounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then you refuse to assist justice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not. But knowing nothing of the circumstances I do not see how I
      can assist you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no doubt you know that Mr. Henfrey evaded us and went away&mdash;that
      he was assisted by a man whom we know as The Sparrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know where he is,&rdquo; replied the girl with truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know The Sparrow,&rdquo; said the detective. &ldquo;You admitted that you had
      met him when I last called here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have met him,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, recollecting that even though she had quarrelled with Hugh,
      the strange old fellow had been his best friend. She remembered how the
      White Cavalier had been sent by him with messages to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse to give away the secrets of my friends,&rdquo; she responded a trifle
      haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you prefer to shield the master criminal of Europe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no knowledge that The Sparrow is a criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the police of any city in Europe. They will tell you that they have
      for years been endeavouring to capture Il Passero. Yet so cleverly is his
      gang organized that never once has he been betrayed. All his friends are
      so loyal to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you want me to betray him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not a member of the gang of criminals, Miss Ranscomb,&rdquo; replied
      Shrimpton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether I am or not, I refuse to say a word concerning anyone who has
      been of service to me,&rdquo; was her stubborn reply. And with that the man from
      the Criminal Investigation Department had to be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then, Dorise was not quite certain whether she had misjudged the man
      who loved her so well, but who was beneath a cloud. She had acted hastily
      in writing that letter, she felt. Yet she had successfully warned him of
      his peril, and he had been able to extricate himself from the net spread
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that The Sparrow, who was her friend and Hugh&rsquo;s, was a most
      elusive person.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recollected the White Cavalier at the ball at Nice, and how she had
      never suspected him to be the deputy of the King of the Underworld&mdash;the
      man whose one hand was gloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within half an hour of the departure of her visitor from Scotland Yard,
      the maid announced Mr. Sherrard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise, with a frown, arose from her chair, and a few seconds later faced
      the man who was her mother&rsquo;s intimate friend, and who daily forced his
      unwelcome attentions upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother told me you would be alone, Dorise,&rdquo; he said in his forced
      manner of affected elegance. &ldquo;So I just dropped in. I hope I&rsquo;m not
      worrying you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! not at all,&rdquo; replied the girl, sealing a letter which she had just
      written. &ldquo;Mother has gone to Warwickshire, and I&rsquo;m going out to lunch with
      May Petheridge, an old schoolfellow of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Then I won&rsquo;t keep you,&rdquo; said the smug lover of Lady Ranscomb&rsquo;s
      choice. He was one of those over-dressed fops who haunted the lounges of
      the Ritz and the Carlton, and who scraped acquaintance with anybody with a
      title. At tea parties he would refer to Lord This and Lady That as
      intimate friends, whereas he had only been introduced to them by some fat
      wife of a fatter profiteer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherrard saw that Dorise&rsquo;s attitude was one of hostility, but with his
      superior overbearing manner he pretended not to notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not at Lady Oundle&rsquo;s the night before last,&rdquo; he remarked, for
      want of something better to say. &ldquo;I went there specially to meet you,
      Dorise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate Lady Oundle&rsquo;s dances,&rdquo; was the girl&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;Such a lot of
      fearful old fogies go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but a lot of your mother&rsquo;s friends are in her set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. But mother always avoids going to her dances if she possibly can.
      We had a good excuse to be away, as mother was packing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elise was there,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you danced with her, of course. She&rsquo;s such a ripping dancer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice. When I found you were not there I went on to the club,&rdquo; he
      replied, with his usual air of boredom. &ldquo;When do you expect your mother
      back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next Tuesday. I&rsquo;m going down to Huntingdon to-morrow to stay with the
      Fishers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! by the way,&rdquo; he remarked suddenly. &ldquo;Tubby Hall, who is just back from
      Madrid, told me in the club last night that he&rsquo;d seen your friend Henfrey
      in a restaurant there with a pretty French girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Madrid!&rdquo; echoed Dorise, for she had no idea of her lover&rsquo;s
      whereabouts. &ldquo;He must have been mistaken surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Tubby is an old friend of Henfrey&rsquo;s. He says that he and the girl
      seemed to be particularly good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dorise hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me this in order to cause me annoyance!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I&rsquo;ve only told you what Tubby said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your friend speak to Mr. Henfrey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. But I really didn&rsquo;t inquire,&rdquo; Sherrard replied, not failing,
      however, to note how puzzled she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ranscomb was already assuring him that the girl&rsquo;s affection for the
      absconding Henfrey would, sooner or later, fade out. More than once he and
      she had held consultation concerning the proposed marriage, and more than
      once Sherrard had been on the point of withdrawing from the contest for
      the young girl&rsquo;s heart. But her mother was never tired of bidding him be
      patient, and saying that in the end he would obtain his desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherrard, however, little dreamed how great was Dorise&rsquo;s love for Hugh,
      and how deeply she regretted having written that hasty letter to Shapley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet one of Hugh&rsquo;s friends had met him in Madrid in company with what was
      described as a pretty young French girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the secret of it all? Was Hugh really guilty of the attempt upon
      the notorious Mademoiselle? If not, why did he not face the charge like a
      man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were her thoughts when, an hour later, her mother&rsquo;s car took her out
      to Kensington to lunch with her old school friend who was on the point of
      being married to a man who had won great distinction in the Air Force, and
      whose portrait was almost daily in the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would she ever marry Hugh, she wondered, as she sat gazing blankly out
      upon the London traffic. She would write to him, but, alas! she knew
      neither the name under which he was going, nor his address.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a telephone message to Mr. Peters&rsquo;s house had been answered to the
      effect that the man whose hand was gloved was abroad, and the date of his
      return uncertain.

      TWENTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SPARROW&rsquo;S NEST
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Lisette met her two guests at Vian&rsquo;s small but exclusive
      restaurant in the Rue Daunou, and all three had a merry meal together.
      Afterwards The Sparrow smoked a good cigar and became amused at the young
      girl&rsquo;s chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a sprightly little person, and had effectively brought off several
      highly successful coups. Before leaving his cosy flat in the Rue des
      Petits Champs, The Sparrow had sat for an hour calmly reviewing the
      situation in the light of what Lisette had told him and of Hugh&rsquo;s exciting
      adventure on the Arles road.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he had successfully escaped from a very clever trap was plain, but
      who was the traitor? Who, indeed, had fired that shot which, failing to
      kill Yvonne, had unbalanced her brain so that no attention could be paid
      to her wandering remarks?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had that morning been on the point of trying to get into touch with his
      friend Howell, but after Lisette&rsquo;s disclosures, he was very glad that he
      had not done so. His master-mind worked quickly. He could sum up a
      situation and act almost instantly where other men would be inclined to
      waver. But when The Sparrow arrived at a decision it was unalterable. All
      his associates knew that too well. Some of them called him stubborn, but
      they had to agree that he was invariably right in his suspicions and
      conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had debated whether he should tell Hugh what Lisette had alleged
      concerning the forgery of his father&rsquo;s will, but had decided to keep the
      matter to himself and see what further proof he could obtain. Therefore he
      had forbidden the girl to tell Henfrey anything, for, after all, it was
      quite likely that her statements could not be substantiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      After their coffee all three returned to the Rue des Petits Champs where
      Lisette, merry and full of vivacity, joined them in a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow had been preoccupied and thoughtful the whole evening. But at
      last, as they sat together, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall all three go south to-morrow&mdash;to Nice direct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Nice!&rdquo; exclaimed Lisette. &ldquo;It is hardly safe&mdash;is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You will leave by the midday train from the Gare de Lyon&mdash;and
      go to Madame Odette&rsquo;s in the boulevard Gambetta. I may want you. We shall
      follow by the <i>train-de-luxe</i>. It is best that Mr. Henfrey is out of
      Paris. The Surete will certainly be searching for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to Hugh, he told him that he had better remain his guest
      that night, and in the morning he would buy him another suit, hat and
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will not be so much risk in Nice as here in Paris,&rdquo; he added.
      &ldquo;After all, we ought not to have ventured out to Vian&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later he sat down, and after referring to a pocket-book containing certain
      entries, he scribbled four cryptic telegrams which were, apparently,
      Bourse quotations, but when read by their addressees were of quite a
      different character.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out and himself dispatched these from the office of the Grand
      Hotel. He never entrusted his telegrams of instructions to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned ten minutes later he took up <i>Le Soir</i>, and
      searching it eagerly, suddenly exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Here it is! Manfield has been successful and got away all right with
      the German countess&rsquo;s trinkets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a laugh he handed the paper to Lisette, who read aloud an account
      of a daring robbery in one of the best hotels in Cologne&mdash;jewels
      valued at a hundred thousand marks having mysteriously disappeared.
      International thieves were suspected, but the Cologne police had no clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&rsquo;sieur Manfield is always extremely shrewd. He is such a real ladies&rsquo; 
      man,&rdquo; laughed Lisette, using some of the <i>argot</i> of the Montmartre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you recollect that American, Lindsay&mdash;with whom you had
      something to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember. I was in London and we went out to dinner together
      quite a lot. Manfield was with me and we got from his dispatch-box the
      papers concerning that oil well at Baku. The company was started later on
      in Chicago, and only two months ago I received my dividend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teddy Manfield is a very good friend,&rdquo; declared the man with the gloved
      hand. &ldquo;Birth and education always count, even in these days. To any
      ex-service man I hold out my hand as the unit who saved us from becoming a
      German colony. But do others? I make war upon those who have profited by
      war. I have never attacked those who have remained honest during the great
      struggle. In the case of dog-eat-dog I place myself on the side of the
      worker and the misled patriot&mdash;not only in Britain, but in all the
      countries of the Allies. If members of the Allied Governments are
      profiteers what can the man-in-the-street expect of the poor little
      scraping-up tradesman oppressed by taxation and bewildered by waste? But
      there!&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I am no politician! My only object is to solve the
      mystery of who shot poor Mademoiselle Yvonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pretty decoy of the great association of <i>escrocs</i> smoked another
      cigarette, and gazed into the young man&rsquo;s face. Sometimes she shuddered
      when she reflected upon all she knew concerning his father&rsquo;s unfortunate
      end, and of the cleverly concocted will by which he was to marry Louise
      Lambert, and afterwards enjoy but a short career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate had made Lisette what she was&mdash;a child of fortune. Her own life
      would, if written, form a strange and sensational narrative. For she had
      been implicated in a number of great robberies which had startled the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew much of the truth of the Henfrey affair, and she had now decided
      to assist Hugh to vanquish those whose intentions were distinctly evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she rose and wished them <i>bon soir</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave the Gare de Lyon at eleven fifty-eight to-morrow, and go
      direct to Madame Odette&rsquo;s in Nice,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Remain there. If I want you I will let you know,&rdquo; answered The
      Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she descended the stairs and walked to her hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next evening Hugh and The Sparrow, both dressed quite differently, left by
      the Riviera <i>train-de-luxe</i>. As The Sparrow lay that night in the <i>wagon-lit</i>
      he tried to sleep, but the roar and rattle of the train prevented it.
      Therefore he calmly thought out a complete and deliberate plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      From one of his friends in London he had had secret warning that the
      police, on the day he left Charing Cross, had descended upon Shapley Manor
      and had arrested Mrs. Bond under a warrant applied for by the French
      police, and he also knew that her extradition for trial in Paris had been
      granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there was a traitor in the camp was proved, but happily Hugh Henfrey
      had escaped just in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For himself The Sparrow cared little. He seemed to be immune from arrest,
      so cleverly did he disguise his true identity; yet now that some person
      had revealed his secrets, what more likely than the person, whoever it
      was, would also give him away for the sake of the big reward which he knew
      was offered for his apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving Paris that evening he had dispatched a telegram, a reply to
      which was handed him in the train when it stopped at Lyons early next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This decided him. He sent another telegram and then returned to where Hugh
      was lying half awake. When they stopped at Marseilles, both men were
      careful not to leave the train, but continued in it, arriving at the great
      station of Nice in the early afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left their bags at a small hotel just outside the station, and taking
      a cab, they drove away into the old town. Afterwards they proceeded on
      foot to the Rue Rossetti, where they climbed to the flat occupied by old
      Giulio Cataldi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fellow was out, but the elderly Italian woman who kept house for
      him said she expected him back at any moment. He was due to come off duty
      at the cafe where he was employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Hugh and his companion waited, examining the poorly-furnished little
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now The Sparrow entertained a strong suspicion that Cataldi knew more of
      the tragedy at the Villa Amette than anyone else. Indeed, of late, it had
      more than once crossed his mind that he might be the actual culprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the door opened and the old man entered, surprised to find himself
      in the presence of the master criminal, The Sparrow, whom he had only met
      once before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He greeted his visitors rather timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short chat The Sparrow, who had offered the old man a cigarette
      from a cheap plated case much worn, began to make certain inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very serious and confidential affair, Cataldi,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      want to know the absolute truth&mdash;and I must have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is serious, signore,&rdquo; replied the old man, much perturbed by
      the unexpected visit of the king of the underworld, the elusive Sparrow of
      whom everyone spoke in awe. &ldquo;But I only know one or two facts. I recognize
      Signor Henfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then you know me!&rdquo; exclaimed Hugh. &ldquo;You recognized me on that night
      at the Villa Amette, when you opened the door to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, signore. I recollect everything. It is all photographed upon my
      memory. Poor Mademoiselle! You questioned her&mdash;as a gentleman would&mdash;and
      you demanded to know about your father&rsquo;s death. She prevaricated&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you overheard it?&rdquo; said Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I listened. Was I not Mademoiselle&rsquo;s servant? On that night she had
      won quite a large sum at the Rooms, and she had given me&mdash;ah! she was
      always most generous&mdash;five hundred francs&mdash;twenty pounds in your
      English money. And they were acceptable in these days of high prices. I
      heard much. I was interested. Mademoiselle was my mistress whom I had
      served faithfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wondered why this young Englishman should call upon her at that
      hour?&rdquo; said The Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. She never received visitors after her five o&rsquo;clock tea. It was the
      habit at the Villa Amette to lunch at one o&rsquo;clock, English tea at five
      o&rsquo;clock, and dinner at eight&mdash;when the Rooms were slack save for the
      tourists from seven till ten. Strange! The tourists always think they can
      win while the gambling world has gone to its meals! They get seats, it is
      true, but they always lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied The Sparrow. &ldquo;It is a strange fact that the greatest losses
      are sustained by the players when the Rooms are most empty. Nobody has yet
      ever been able to account for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it is so,&rdquo; declared old Cataldi. &ldquo;I have watched it day by day.
      But poor Mademoiselle! What can we do to solve the mystery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you not with Mademoiselle and Mr. Benton when you both brought off
      that great coup in the Avenue Louise, in Brussels?&rdquo; asked The Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, signore,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;But I do not wish to speak of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite naturally. I quite appreciate it. Since Mademoiselle&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;accident
      you have, I suppose, been leading an honest life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have tried to do so. At present I am a cafe waiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can tell me nothing further regarding the affair at the Villa
      Amette?&rdquo; asked The Sparrow, eyeing him narrowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret, signore, I can tell you nothing further,&rdquo; replied the staid,
      rather sad-looking old man; &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo; And he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the man whose tentacles were, like an octopus, upon a hundred
      schemes, and as many criminal coups in Europe. He sought a solution of the
      problem, but nothing appeared forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had strained every effort, but he could ascertain nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Cataldi knew the key to the whole problem The Sparrow felt assured.
      Yet why did not the old fellow tell the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      At last The Sparrow rose and left, and Hugh followed him. Both were
      bitterly disappointed. The old man refused to say more than that he was
      ignorant of the whole affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cataldi&rsquo;s attitude annoyed the master criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days he remained in Nice with Hugh, at great risk of recognition
      and arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day they went together in a hired car along the winding road
      across the Var to Cannes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a big white villa a little distance outside the pretty winter town of
      flowers and palms, they halted. The house, which was on the Frejus road,
      was once the residence of a Russian prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      With The Sparrow Hugh was ushered into a big, sunny room overlooking the
      beautiful garden where climbing geraniums ran riot with carnations and
      violets, and for some minutes they waited. From the windows spread a wide
      view of the calm sapphire sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly the door opened.
    </p>

    <h2>
      TWENTY-NINTH CHAPTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE STORY OF MADEMOISELLE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Both men turned and before them they saw the plainly dressed figure of a
      beautiful woman, and behind her an elderly, grey-faced man.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few seconds the woman stared at The Sparrow blankly. Then she turned
      her gaze upon Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips parted. Suddenly she gave vent to a loud cry, almost of pain, and
      placing both hands to her head, gasped:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Dieu!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Yvonne Ferad. And the cry was one of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh dashed forward with the doctor, for she was on the point of collapse
      at recognizing them. But in a few seconds she recovered herself, though
      she was deathly pale and much agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yvonne!&rdquo; exclaimed The Sparrow in a low, kindly voice. &ldquo;Then you know who
      we really are? Your reason has returned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered in French. &ldquo;I remember who you are. Ah! But&mdash;but
      it is all so strange!&rdquo; she cried wildly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think!
      At last! Yes. I know. I recollect! You!&rdquo; And she stared at Hugh. &ldquo;You&mdash;you
      are <i>Monsieur Henfrey</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, messieurs,&rdquo; remarked the elderly doctor, who was standing behind his
      patient. &ldquo;She recognized you both&mdash;after all! The sudden shock at
      seeing you has accomplished what we have failed all these months to
      accomplish. It is efficacious only in some few cases. In this it is
      successful. But be careful. I beg of you not to overtax poor
      mademoiselle&rsquo;s brain with many questions. I will leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he withdrew, closing the door softly after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes The Sparrow spoke to Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo about
      general things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been very ill,&rdquo; she said in a low, tremulous voice. &ldquo;I could think
      of nothing since my accident, until now&mdash;and now&rdquo;&mdash;and she gazed
      around her with a new interest upon her handsome countenance&mdash;&ldquo;and
      now I remember!&mdash;but it all seems too hazy and indistinct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You recollect things&mdash;eh?&rdquo; asked The Sparrow in a kindly voice,
      placing his hand upon her shoulder and looking into her tired eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I remember. All the past is slowly returning to me. It seems ages
      and ages since I last met you, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Peters,&rdquo; and she laughed
      lightly. &ldquo;Peters&mdash;that is the name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;And it is a happy event that, by
      seeing us unexpectedly, your memory has returned. But the reason Mr.
      Henfrey is here is to resume that conversation which was so suddenly
      interrupted at the Villa Amette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle was silent for some moments. Her face was averted, for she
      was gazing out of the window to the distant sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to reveal to Monsieur Henfrey the&mdash;the secret of his
      father&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; she asked of The Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. You were about to do so when&mdash;when the accident
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But&mdash;but, oh!&mdash;how can I tell him the actual truth when&mdash;when,
      alas! I am so guilty?&rdquo; cried the woman, much distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Hugh, placing his hand tenderly upon her
      shoulder. &ldquo;Calm yourself. You did not kill my father. Of that I am quite
      convinced. Do not distress yourself, but tell me all that you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Peters knows something of the affair, I believe,&rdquo; she said slowly.
      &ldquo;But he never planned it. The whole plot was concocted by Benton.&rdquo; Then,
      turning to Hugh, Mademoiselle said almost in her natural tone, though
      slightly high-pitched and nervous:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benton, the blackguard, was your father&rsquo;s friend at Woodthorpe. With a
      man named Howell, known also as Shaw, he prepared a will which your father
      signed unconsciously, and which provided that in the event of his death
      you should be cut off from almost every benefit if you did not marry
      Louise Lambert, Benton&rsquo;s adopted daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is Louise actually?&rdquo; asked Hugh interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The real daughter of Benton, who has made pretence of adopting her. Of
      course Louise is unaware of that fact,&rdquo; Yvonne replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh was much surprised at this. But he now saw the reason why Mrs. Bond
      was so solicitous of the poor girl&rsquo;s welfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I happened to be in London, and on one of your father&rsquo;s visits to
      town, Benton, his friend, introduced us. Naturally I had no knowledge of
      the plot which Benton and Howell had formed, and finding your father a
      very agreeable gentleman, I invited him to the furnished flat I had taken
      at Queen&rsquo;s Gate. I went to the theatre with him on two occasions, Benton
      accompanying us, and then your father returned to the country. One day,
      about two months later Howell happened to be in London, and presumably
      they decided that the plot was ripe for execution, for they asked me to
      write to Mr. Henfrey at Woodthorpe, and suggest that he should come to
      London, have an early supper with us, and go to a big charity ball at the
      Albert Hall. In due course I received a wire from Mr. Henfrey, who came to
      London, had supper with me, Benton and Howell being also present, while
      Howell&rsquo;s small closed car, which he always drove himself, was waiting
      outside to take us to the ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she paused and drew a long breath, as though the recollection of that
      night horrified her&mdash;as indeed it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After supper I rose and left the room to speak to my servant for a
      moment, when, just as I re-entered, I saw Howell, who was standing behind
      Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s chair, suddenly bend, place his left arm around your
      father&rsquo;s neck, and with his right hand press on the nape of the neck just
      above his collar. &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; your father cried out, thinking it was a joke,
      &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the game?&rsquo; But the last word was scarcely audible, for he
      collapsed across the table. I stood there aghast. Howell, suddenly
      noticing me, told me roughly to clear out, as I was not wanted. I demanded
      to know what had happened, but I was told that it did not concern me. My
      idea was that Mr. Henfrey had been drugged, for he was still alive and
      apparently dazed. I afterwards heard, however, that Howell had pressed the
      needle of a hypodermic syringe containing a newly discovered and
      untraceable poison which he had obtained in secret from a certain chemist
      in Frankfort, who makes a speciality of such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what happened then?&rdquo; asked Hugh, aghast and astounded at the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benton and Howell sent me out of the room. They waited for over an hour.
      Then Howell went down to the car. Afterwards, when all was clear, they
      half carried poor Mr. Henfrey downstairs, placed him in the car, and drove
      away. Next day I heard that my guest had been found by a constable in a
      doorway in Albemarle Street. The officer, who first thought he was
      intoxicated, later took him to St. George&rsquo;s Hospital, where he died.
      Afterwards a scratch was found on the palm of his hand, and the doctors
      believed it had been caused by a pin infected with some poison. The truth
      was, however, that his hand was scratched in opening a bottle of champagne
      at supper. The doctors never suspected the tiny puncture in the hair at
      the nape of the neck, and they never discovered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew nothing of the affair,&rdquo; declared The Sparrow, his face clouded by
      anger. &ldquo;Then Howell was the actual murderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; Yvonne replied. &ldquo;I saw him press the needle into Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s
      neck, while Benton stood by, ready to seize the victim if he resisted.
      Benton and Howell had agreed to kill Mr. Henfrey, compel his son to marry
      Louise, and then get Hugh out of the world by one or other of their
      devilish schemes. Ah!&rdquo; she sighed, looking sadly before her. &ldquo;I see it all
      now&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was arranged that after I had married Louise I should also meet
      with an unexpected end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. One that should discredit you in the eyes of your wife and your own
      friends&mdash;an end probably like your father&rsquo;s. A secret visit to
      London, and a mysterious death,&rdquo; Mademoiselle replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke quite calmly and rationally. The shock of suddenly encountering
      the two persons who had been uppermost in her thoughts before those
      terrible injuries to her brain had balanced it again. Though the pains in
      her head were excruciating, as she explained, yet she could now think, and
      she remembered all the bitterness of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, M&rsquo;sieur Henfrey, are the son of my dead friend. You have been the
      victim of a great and dastardly conspiracy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I ask your
      forgiveness, for I assure you that when I invited your father up from
      Woodthorpe I had no idea whatever of what those assassins intended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benton is already under arrest for another affair,&rdquo; broke in The Sparrow
      quietly. &ldquo;I heard so from London yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! And I hope that Howell will also be punished for his crime,&rdquo; the
      handsome woman cried. &ldquo;Though I have been a thief, a swindler, and a decoy&mdash;ah!
      yes, I admit it all&mdash;I have never committed the crime of murder. I
      know, messieurs,&rdquo; she went on&mdash;&ldquo;I know that I am a social outcast,
      the mysterious Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo, they call me! But I have
      suffered. I have indeed in these past months paid my debt to Society, and
      of you, Mr. Henfrey, I beg forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; Hugh replied, grasping her slim, white
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle will, I hope, meet Miss Ranscomb, Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s fiancee, and
      tell her the whole truth,&rdquo; said The Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I certainly will,&rdquo; Yvonne replied. &ldquo;Now that I can think I shall be
      allowed to leave this place&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I will see after that,&rdquo; said the man known as Mr. Peters. &ldquo;You
      must return to the Villa Amette&mdash;for you are still Mademoiselle of
      Monte Carlo, remember! Leave it all to me.&rdquo; And he laughed happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are no nearer the solution of the mystery as to who attempted to
      kill you, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; Hugh remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be but one person. Old Cataldi knows who it is,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cataldi? Then why has he not told me? I questioned him closely only the
      other day,&rdquo; said The Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For certain reasons,&rdquo; Mademoiselle replied. &ldquo;He <i>dare</i> not tell the
      truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and she turned to The Sparrow. &ldquo;You
      will recollect the affair we brought off in Brussels at that house of the
      Belgian baroness close to the Bois de la Cambre. A servant was shot dead.
      Giulio Cataldi shot him in self-defence. But Howell knows of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked The Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howell was in Monte Carlo on the night of the attempt upon me. I met him
      in the Casino half an hour before I left to walk home. He no doubt
      recognized Mr. Henfrey, who was also there, as the son of the man whom he
      had murdered, watched him, and followed him up to my villa. He suspected
      that Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s object was to face me and demand an explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; gasped Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that I feel positive. Only Cataldi can prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Cataldi?&rdquo; inquired Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See him again and tell him what I have revealed to you,&rdquo; answered
      Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it who warned me against you by that letter posted in Tours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was part of Howell&rsquo;s scheme, no doubt. I have no idea of the identity
      of the writer of any anonymous letter. But Howell, no doubt, saw that if
      he rid himself of me it would be to his great advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Cataldi will not speak the truth because he fears Howell?&rdquo; remarked
      the notorious chief of Europe&rsquo;s underworld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Now that I can think, I can piece the whole puzzle together. It
      is all quite plain. Do you not recollect Howell&rsquo;s curious rifle fashioned
      in the form of a walking-stick? When I halted to speak to Madame Beranger
      on the steps of the Casino as I came out that night, he passed me carrying
      that stick. Indeed, he is seldom without it. By means of that disguised
      rifle I was shot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you speak of Cataldi. How can he know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I entered the house I told him quickly that I believed Howell was
      following me. I ordered him to watch. This no doubt he did. He has ever
      been faithful to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy why should Howell have attempted to fix his guilt upon Mr. Henfrey?&rdquo;
       asked The Sparrow. &ldquo;In doing so he was defeating his own aims. If Mr.
      Henfrey were sent to prison he could not marry Louise Lambert, and if he
      had married Louise he would have benefited Howell! Therefore the whole
      plot was nullified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, m&rsquo;sieur. Howell attempted to kill me in order to preserve his
      secret, fearing that if I told Mr. Henfrey the truth he would inform the
      police of the circumstances of his father&rsquo;s assassination. In making the
      attempt he defeated his own ends&mdash;a fact which he only realized when
      too late!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The foregoing is perhaps one of the most remarkable stories of the
      underworld of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its details are set down in full in three big portfolios in the archives
      of the Surete in Paris&mdash;where the present writer has had access to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that bald official narrative which is docketed under the heading &ldquo;No.
      23489/263&mdash;Henfrey&rdquo; there is no mention of the love affair between
      Dorise Ranscomb and Hugh Henfrey of Woodthorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the true facts are that within three days of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s recovery
      of her mental balance, old Giulio Cataldi made a sworn statement to the
      police at Nice, and in consequence two gendarmes of the Department of
      Seine et Oise went one night to a small hotel at Provins, where they
      arrested the Englishman, Shaw, alias Howell, who had gone there in what he
      thought was safe hiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrest took place at midnight, but Howell, on being cornered in his
      bedroom, showed fight, and raising an automatic pistol, which he had under
      his pillow, shot and wounded one of the gendarmes. Whereupon his companion
      drew his revolver in self-defence and shot the Englishman dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benton, a few months later, was sentenced to forced labour for fifteen
      years, while his accomplice, Molly Bond, received a sentence of ten years.
      Only one case&mdash;that of jewel robbery&mdash;was, however, proved
      against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorise, about six weeks after Mademoiselle Yvonne&rsquo;s explanation, met her
      in London, and there she and Hugh became reconciled. Her jealousy of
      Louise Lambert disappeared when she knew the actual truth, and she admired
      her lover all the more for his generosity in promising, when the Probate
      Court had set aside the false will, that he would settle a comfortable
      income upon the poor innocent girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, indeed, he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sparrow has never since been traced, though Scotland Yard and the
      Surete have searched everywhere for him. But he is far too clever. The
      writer believes he is now living in obscurity, but perfectly happy, in a
      little village outside Barcelona. He loves the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Hugh, he is now happily married to Dorise, and as the Probate Court
      has decided that Woodthorpe and the substantial income are his, he is
      enjoying all his father&rsquo;s wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yvonne Ferad is still Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo. She still lives on the
      hill in the picturesque Villa Amette, and is still known to the habitues
      of the Rooms as&mdash;Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo.
    </p>
    <p>
      On most nights in spring she can be seen at the Rooms, and those who know
      the truth tell the queer story which I have in the foregoing pages
      attempted to relate.
    </p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
